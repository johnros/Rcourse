Rosenblatt 2018-05-13 Chapter 1 Preface This book accompanies BGU’s “R” course, at the department of Industrial Engineering and Management. It has several purposes: Help me organize and document the course material. Help students during class so that they may focus on listening and not writing. Help students after class, so that they may self-study. At its current state it is experimental. It can thus be expected to change from time to time, and include mistakes. I will be enormously grateful to whoever decides to share with me any mistakes found. I am enormously grateful to Yihui Xie, who’s bookdown R package made it possible to easily write a book which has many mathematical formulae, and R output. I hope the reader will find this text interesting and useful. For reproducing my results you will want to run set.seed(1). 1.1 Notation Conventions In this text we use the following conventions: Lower case \\(x\\) may be a vector or a scalar, random of fixed, as implied by the context. Upper case \\(A\\) will stand for matrices. Equality \\(=\\) is an equality, and \\(:=\\) is a definition. Norm functions are denoted with \\(\\Vert x \\Vert\\) for vector norms, and \\(\\Vert A \\Vert\\) for matrix norms. The type of norm is indicated in the subscript; e.g. \\(\\Vert x \\Vert_2\\) for the Euclidean (\\(l_2\\)) norm. Tag, \\(x&#39;\\) is a transpose. The distribution of a random vector is \\(\\sim\\). 1.2 Acknowledgements I have consulted many people during the writing of this text. I would like to thank Yoav Kessler, Lena Novack, Efrat Vilenski, Ron Sarafian, and Liad Shekel in particular, for their valuable inputs. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is R? 2.2 The R Ecosystem 2.3 Bibliographic Notes 2.4 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is R? R was not designed to be a bona-fide programming language. It is an evolution of the S language, developed at Bell labs (later Lucent) as a wrapper for the endless collection of statistical libraries they wrote in Fortran. As of 2011, half of R’s libraries are actually written in C. For more on the history of R see AT&amp;T’s site, John Chamber’s talk at UserR! 2014 or the Introduction to the excellent Venables and Ripley (2013). 2.2 The R Ecosystem A large part of R’s success is due to the ease in which a user, or a firm, can augment it. This led to a large community of users, developers, and protagonists. Some of the most important parts of R’s ecosystem include: CRAN: a repository for R packages, mirrored worldwide. R-help: an immensely active mailing list. Noways being replaced by StackExchange meta-site. Look for the R tags in the StackOverflow and CrossValidated sites. Task Views: part of CRAN that collects packages per topic. Bioconductor: A CRAN-like repository dedicated to the life sciences. Neuroconductor: A CRAN-like repository dedicated to neuroscience, and neuroimaging. Books: An insane amount of books written on the language. Some are free, some are not. The Israeli-R-user-group: just like the name suggests. Commercial R: being open source and lacking support may seem like a problem that would prohibit R from being adopted for commercial applications. This void is filled by several very successful commercial versions such as Microsoft R, with its accompanying CRAN equivalent called MRAN, Tibco’s Spotfire, and others. RStudio: since its earliest days R came equipped with a minimal text editor. It later received plugins for major integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, WinEdit and even VisualStudio. None of these, however, had the impact of the RStudio IDE. Written completely in JavaScript, the RStudio IDE allows the seamless integration of cutting edge web-design technologies, remote access, and other killer features, making it today’s most popular IDE for R. 2.3 Bibliographic Notes 2.4 Practice Yourself References "],

If you have any experience at all with R, you can probably skip this section. First, make sure you work with the RStudio IDE. Some useful pointers for this IDE include: Ctrl+Return(Enter) to run lines from editor. Alt+Shift+k for RStudio keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl+r to browse the command history. Alt+Shift+j to navigate between code sections tab for auto-completion Ctrl+1 to skip to editor. Ctrl+2 to skip to console. Ctrl+8 to skip to the environment list. Code Folding: Alt+l collapse chunk. Alt+Shift+l unfold chunk. Alt+o collapse all. Alt+Shift+o unfold all. Alt+“-” for the assignment operator &lt;-. 3.0.1 Other IDEs Currently, I recommend RStudio, but here are some other IDEs: Jupyter Lab: a very promising IDE, originally designed for Python, that also supports R. At the time of writing, it seems that RStudio is more convenient for R, but it is definetly an IDE to follow closely. See Max Woolf’s review. Eclipse: If you are a Java programmer, you are probably familiar with Eclipse, which does have an R plugin: StatEt. Emacs: If you are an Emacs fan, you can find an R plugin: ESS. Vim: Vim-R. Visual Studio also supports R. If you need R for commercial purposes, it may be worthwhile trying Microsoft’s R, instead of the usual R. See here for installation instructions. 3.1 File types The file types you need to know when using R are the following: .R: An ASCII text file containing R scripts only. .Rmd: An ASCII text file. If opened in RStudio can be run as an R-Notebook or compiled using knitr, bookdown, etc. 3.2 Simple calculator R can be used as a simple calculator. Create a new R Notebook (.Rmd file) within RStudio using File-&gt; New -&gt; R Notebook, and run the following commands. 10+5 ## [1] 15 70*81 ## [1] 5670 2**4 ## [1] 16 2^4 ## [1] 16 log(10) ## [1] 2.302585 log(16, 2) ## [1] 4 log(1000, 10) ## [1] 3 3.3 Probability calculator R can be used as a probability calculator. You probably wish you knew this when you did your Intro To Probability classes. The Binomial distribution function: dbinom(x=3, size=10, prob=0.5) # Compute P(X=3) for X~B(n=10, p=0.5) ## [1] 0.1171875 Notice that arguments do not need to be named explicitly dbinom(3, 10, 0.5) ## [1] 0.1171875 The Binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF): pbinom(q=3, size=10, prob=0.5) # Compute P(X&lt;=3) for X~B(n=10, p=0.5) ## [1] 0.171875 The Binomial quantile function: qbinom(p=0.1718, size=10, prob=0.5) # For X~B(n=10, p=0.5) returns k such that P(X&lt;=k)=0.1718 ## [1] 3 Generate random variables: rbinom(n=10, size=10, prob=0.5) ## [1] 4 4 5 7 4 7 7 6 6 3 R has many built-in distributions. Their names may change, but the prefixes do not: d prefix for the distribution function. p prefix for the cummulative distribution function (CDF). q prefix for the quantile function (i.e., the inverse CDF). r prefix to generate random samples. Demonstrating this idea, using the CDF of several popular distributions: pbinom() for the Binomial CDF. ppois() for the Poisson CDF. pnorm() for the Gaussian CDF. pexp() for the Exponential CDF. For more information see ?distributions. 3.4 Getting Help One of the most important parts of working with a language, is to know where to find help. R has several in-line facilities, besides the various help resources in the R ecosystem. Get help for a particular function. ?dbinom help(dbinom) If you don’t know the name of the function you are looking for, search local help files for a particular string: ??binomial help.search(&#39;dbinom&#39;) Or load a menu where you can navigate local help in a web-based fashion: help.start() 3.5 Variable Asignment Assignment of some output into an object named “x”: x = rbinom(n=10, size=10, prob=0.5) # Works. Bad style. x &lt;- rbinom(n=10, size=10, prob=0.5) If you are familiar with other programming languages you may prefer the = assignment rather than the &lt;- assignment. We recommend you make the effort to change your preferences. This is because thinking with &lt;- helps to read your code, distinguishes between assignments and function arguments: think of function(argument=value) versus function(argument&lt;-value). It also helps understand special assignment operators such as &lt;&lt;- and -&gt;. Remark. Style: We do not discuss style guidelines in this text, but merely remind the reader that good style is extremely important. When you write code, think of other readers, but also think of future self. See Hadley’s style guide for more. To print the contents of an object just type its name x ## [1] 7 4 6 3 4 5 2 5 7 4 which is an implicit call to print(x) ## [1] 7 4 6 3 4 5 2 5 7 4 Alternatively, you can assign and print simultaneously using parenthesis. (x &lt;- rbinom(n=10, size=10, prob=0.5)) # Assign and print. ## [1] 5 5 5 4 6 6 6 3 6 5 Operate on the object mean(x) # compute mean ## [1] 5.1 var(x) # compute variance ## [1] 0.9888889 hist(x) # plot histogram R saves every object you create in RAM1. The collection of all such objects is the workspace which you can inspect with ls() ## [1] &quot;x&quot; or with Ctrl+8 in RStudio. If you lost your object, you can use ls with a text pattern to search for it ls(pattern=&#39;x&#39;) ## [1] &quot;x&quot; To remove objects from the workspace: rm(x) # remove variable ls() # verify ## character(0) You may think that if an object is removed then its memory is freed. This is almost true, and depends on a negotiation mechanism between R and the operating system. R’s memory management is discussed in Chapter 15. 3.6 Missing Unlike typically programming, when working with real life data, you may have missing values: measurements that were simply not recorded/stored/etc. R has rather sophisticated mechanisms to deal with missing values. It distinguishes between the following types: NA: Not Available entries. NaN: Not a number. R tries to defend the analyst, and return an error, or NA when the presence of missing values invalidates the calculation: missing.example &lt;- c(10,11,12,NA) mean(missing.example) ## [1] NA Most functions will typically have an inner mechanism to deal with these. In the mean function, there is an na.rm argument, telling R how to Remove NAs. mean(missing.example, na.rm = TRUE) ## [1] 11 A more general mechanism is removing these manually: clean.example &lt;- na.omit(missing.example) mean(clean.example) ## [1] 11 3.7 Piping Because R originates in Unix and Linux environments, it inherits much of its flavor. Piping is an idea taken from the Linux shell which allows to use the output of one expression as the input to another. Piping thus makes code easier to read and write. Remark. Volleyball fans may be confused with the idea of spiking a ball from the 3-meter line, also called piping. So: (a) These are very different things. (b) If you can pipe, ASA-BGU is looking for you! Prerequisites: library(magrittr) # load the piping functions x &lt;- rbinom(n=1000, size=10, prob=0.5) # generate some toy data Examples x %&gt;% var() # Instead of var(x) x %&gt;% hist() # Instead of hist(x) x %&gt;% mean() %&gt;% round(2) %&gt;% add(10) The next example2 demonstrates the benefits of piping. The next two chunks of code do the same thing. Try parsing them in your mind: # Functional (onion) style car_data &lt;- transform(aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = subset(mtcars, hp &gt; 100), FUN = function(x) round(mean(x, 2))), kpl = mpg*0.4251) # Piping (magrittr) style car_data &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% subset(hp &gt; 100) %&gt;% aggregate(. ~ cyl, data = ., FUN = . %&gt;% mean %&gt;% round(2)) %&gt;% transform(kpl = mpg %&gt;% multiply_by(0.4251)) %&gt;% print Tip: RStudio has a keyboard shortcut for the %&gt;% operator. Try Ctrl+Shift+m. 3.8 Vector Creation and Manipulation The most basic building block in R is the vector. We will now see how to create them, and access their elements (i.e. subsetting). Here are three ways to create the same arbitrary vector: c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) # manually 10:21 # the `:` operator seq(from=10, to=21, by=1) # the seq() function Let’s assign it to the object named “x”: x &lt;- c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) Operations usually work element-wise: x+2 ## [1] 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 x*2 ## [1] 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 x^2 ## [1] 100 121 144 169 196 225 256 289 324 361 400 441 sqrt(x) ## [1] 3.162278 3.316625 3.464102 3.605551 3.741657 3.872983 4.000000 ## [8] 4.123106 4.242641 4.358899 4.472136 4.582576 log(x) ## [1] 2.302585 2.397895 2.484907 2.564949 2.639057 2.708050 2.772589 ## [8] 2.833213 2.890372 2.944439 2.995732 3.044522 3.9 Search Paths and Packages R can be easily extended with packages, which are merely a set of documented functions, which can be loaded or unloaded conveniently. Let’s look at the function read.csv. We can see its contents by calling it without arguments: read.csv ## function (file, header = TRUE, sep = &quot;,&quot;, quote = &quot;\\&quot;&quot;, dec = &quot;.&quot;, ## fill = TRUE, comment.char = &quot;&quot;, ...) ## read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, ## dec = dec, fill = fill, comment.char = comment.char, ...) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x55c9d68&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:utils&gt; Never mind what the function does. Note the environment: namespace:utils line at the end. It tells us that this function is part of the utils package. We did not need to know this because it is loaded by default. Here are some packages that I have currently loaded: head(search()) ## [1] &quot;.GlobalEnv&quot; &quot;package:doSNOW&quot; &quot;package:snow&quot; ## [4] &quot;package:doParallel&quot; &quot;package:parallel&quot; &quot;package:iterators&quot; Other packages can be loaded via the library function, or downloaded from the internet using the install.packages function before loading with library. R’s package import mechanism is quite powerful, and is one of the reasons for R’s success. 3.10 Simple Plotting R has many plotting facilities as we will further detail in the Plotting Chapter 11. We start with the simplest facilities, namely, the plot function from the graphics package, which is loaded by default. x&lt;- 1:100 y&lt;- 3+sin(x) plot(x = x, y = y) # x,y syntax Given an x argument and a y argument, plot tries to present a scatter plot. We call this the x,y syntax. R has another unique syntax to state functional relations. We call y~x the “tilde” syntax, which originates in works of G. Wilkinson and Rogers (1973) and was adopted in the early days of S. plot(y ~ x) # y~x syntax The syntax y~x is read as “y is a function of x”. We will prefer the y~x syntax over the x,y syntax since it is easier to read, and will be very useful when we discuss more complicated models. Here are some arguments that control the plot’s appearance. We use type to control the plot type, main to control the main title. plot(y~x, type=&#39;l&#39;, main=&#39;Plotting a connected line&#39;) We use xlab for the x-axis label, ylab for the y-axis. plot(y~x, type=&#39;h&#39;, main=&#39;Sticks plot&#39;, xlab=&#39;Insert x axis label&#39;, ylab=&#39;Insert y axis label&#39;) We use pch to control the point type. plot(y~x, pch=5) # Point type with pcf We use col to control the color, cex for the point size, and abline to add a straight line. plot(y~x, pch=10, type=&#39;p&#39;, col=&#39;blue&#39;, cex=4) abline(3, 0.002) For more plotting options run these example(plot) example(points) ?plot help(package=&#39;graphics&#39;) When your plotting gets serious, go to Chapter 11. 3.11 Object Types We already saw that the basic building block of R objects is the vector. Vectors can be of the following types: character Where each element is a string, i.e., a sequence of alphanumeric symbols. numeric Where each element is a real number in double precision floating point format. integer Where each element is an integer. logical Where each element is either TRUE, FALSE, or NA3 complex Where each element is a complex number. list Where each element is an arbitrary R object. factor Factors are not actually vector objects, but they feel like such. They are used to encode any finite set of values. This will be very useful when fitting linear model because they include information on contrasts, i.e., on the encoding of the factors levels. You should always be alert and recall when you are dealing with a factor or with a character vector. They have different behaviors. Vectors can be combined into larger objects. A matrix can be thought of as the binding of several vectors of the same type. In reality, a matrix is merely a vector with a dimension attribute, that tells R to read it as a matrix and not a vector. If vectors of different types (but same length) are binded, we get a data.frame which is the most fundamental object in R for data analysis. Data frames are brilliant, but a lot has been learned since their invention. They have thus been extended in recent years with the tbl class, pronounced [Tibble] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html), and the data.table class. The latter is discussed in Chapter 21, and is strongly recommended. 3.12 Data Frames Creating a simple data frame: x&lt;- 1:10 y&lt;- 3 + sin(x) frame1 &lt;- data.frame(x=x, sin=y) Let’s inspect our data frame: head(frame1) ## x sin ## 1 1 3.841471 ## 2 2 3.909297 ## 3 3 3.141120 ## 4 4 2.243198 ## 5 5 2.041076 ## 6 6 2.720585 Now using the RStudio Excel-like viewer: frame1 %&gt;% View() We highly advise against editing the data this way since there will be no documentation of the changes you made. Always transform your data using scripts, so that everything is documented. Verifying this is a data frame: class(frame1) # the object is of type data.frame ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; Check the dimension of the data dim(frame1) ## [1] 10 2 Note that checking the dimension of a vector is different than checking the dimension of a data frame. length(x) ## [1] 10 The length of a data.frame is merely the number of columns. length(frame1) ## [1] 2 3.13 Exctraction R provides many ways to subset and extract elements from vectors and other objects. The basics are fairly simple, but not paying attention to the “personality” of each extraction mechanism may cause you a lot of headache. For starters, extraction is done with the [ operator. The operator can take vectors of many types. Extracting element with by integer index: frame1[1, 2] # exctract the element in the 1st row and 2nd column. ## [1] 3.841471 Extract column by index: frame1[,1] ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Extract column by name: frame1[, &#39;sin&#39;] ## [1] 3.841471 3.909297 3.141120 2.243198 2.041076 2.720585 3.656987 ## [8] 3.989358 3.412118 2.455979 As a general rule, extraction with [ will conserve the class of the parent object. There are, however, exceptions. Notice the extraction mechanism and the class of the output in the following examples. class(frame1[, &#39;sin&#39;]) # extracts a column vector ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; class(frame1[&#39;sin&#39;]) # extracts a data frame ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(frame1[,1:2]) # extracts a data frame ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(frame1[2]) # extracts a data frame ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(frame1[2, ]) # extract a data frame ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; class(frame1$sin) # extracts a column vector ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; The subset() function does the same subset(frame1, select=sin) subset(frame1, select=2) subset(frame1, select= c(2,0)) If you want to force the stripping of the class attribute when extracting, try the [[ mechanism instead of [. a &lt;- frame1[1] # [ extraction b &lt;- frame1[[1]] # [[ extraction class(a)==class(b) # objects have differing classes ## [1] FALSE a==b # objects are element-wise identical ## x ## [1,] TRUE ## [2,] TRUE ## [3,] TRUE ## [4,] TRUE ## [5,] TRUE ## [6,] TRUE ## [7,] TRUE ## [8,] TRUE ## [9,] TRUE ## [10,] TRUE The different types of output classes cause different behaviors. Compare the behavior of [ on seemingly identical objects. frame1[1][1] ## x ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 ## 5 5 ## 6 6 ## 7 7 ## 8 8 ## 9 9 ## 10 10 frame1[[1]][1] ## [1] 1 If you want to learn more about subsetting see Hadley’s guide. 3.14 Non data.frame object classes As previously mentioned, the data.frame class has been extended in recent years. The best known extensions are the data.table and the tbl. For beginners, it is important to know R’s basics, so we keep focusing on data frames. For more advanced users, I recommend learning the (amazing) data.table syntax. 3.15 Data Import and Export For any practical purpose, you will not be generating your data manually. R comes with many importing and exporting mechanisms which we now present. If, however, you do a lot of data “munging”, make sure to see Hadley-verse Chapter 13. If you work with MASSIVE data sets, read the Memory Efficiency Chapter 15. 3.15.1 Import from WEB The read.table function is the main importing workhorse. It can import directly from the web. URL &lt;- &#39;http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/datasets/bone.data&#39; tirgul1 &lt;- read.table(URL) Always look at the imported result! head(tirgul1) ## V1 V2 V3 V4 ## 1 idnum age gender spnbmd ## 2 1 11.7 male 0.01808067 ## 3 1 12.7 male 0.06010929 ## 4 1 13.75 male 0.005857545 ## 5 2 13.25 male 0.01026393 ## 6 2 14.3 male 0.2105263 Ohh dear. read.,table tried to guess the structure of the input, but failed to recognize the header row. Set it manually with header=TRUE: tirgul1 &lt;- read.table(&#39;data/bone.data&#39;, header = TRUE) head(tirgul1) 3.15.2 Export as CSV Let’s write a simple file so that we have something to import head(airquality) # examine the data to export ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 temp.file.name &lt;- tempfile() # get some arbitrary file name write.csv(x = airquality, file = temp.file.name) # export Now let’s import the exported file. Being a .csv file, I can use read.csv instead of read.table. my.data&lt;- read.csv(file=temp.file.name) # import head(my.data) # verify import ## X Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 ## 6 6 28 NA 14.9 66 5 6 Remark. Windows users may need to use “\\” instead of “/”. 3.15.3 Export non-CSV files You can export your R objects in endlessly many ways: If instead of the comma delimiter in .csv you want other column delimiters, look into ?write.table. If you are exporting only for R users, you can consider exporting as binary objects with saveRDS, feather::write_feather, or fst::write.fst. See (http://www.fstpackage.org/) for a comparison. 3.15.4 Reading From Text Files Some general notes on importing text files via the read.table function. But first, we need to know what is the active directory. Here is how to get and set R’s active directory: getwd() #What is the working directory? setwd() #Setting the working directory in Linux We can now call the read.table function to import text files. If you care about your sanity, see ?read.table before starting imports. Some notable properties of the function: read.table will try to guess column separators (tab, comma, etc.) read.table will try to guess if a header row is present. read.table will convert character vectors to factors unless told not to using the stringsAsFactors=FALSE argument. The output of read.table needs to be explicitly assigned to an object for it to be saved. 3.15.5 Writing Data to Text Files The function write.table is the exporting counterpart of read.table. 3.15.6 .XLS(X) files Strongly recommended to convert to .csv in Excel, and then import as csv. If you still insist see the xlsx package. 3.15.7 Massive files The above importing and exporting mechanisms were not designed for massive files. See the section on the data.table package (21), Sparse Representation (14), and Out-of-Ram Algorithms (15) for more on working with massive data files. 3.15.8 Databases R does not need to read from text files; it can read directly from a database. This is very useful since it allows the filtering, selecting and joining operations to rely on the database’s optimized algorithms. Then again, if you will only be analyzing your data with R, you are probably better of by working from a file, without the databases’ overhead. See Chapter 15 for more on this matter. 3.16 Functions One of the most basic building blocks of programming is the ability of writing your own functions. A function in R, like everything else, is an object accessible using its name. We first define a simple function that sums its two arguments my.sum &lt;- function(x,y) { return(x+y) } my.sum(10,2) ## [1] 12 From this example you may notice that: The function function tells R to construct a function object. Unlike some programming languages, a period (.) is allowed as part of an object’s name. The arguments of the function, i.e. (x,y), need to be named but we are not required to specify their class. This makes writing functions very easy, but it is also the source of many bugs, and slowness of R compared to type declaring languages (C, Fortran,Java,…). A typical R function does not change objects4 but rather creates new ones. To save the output of my.sum we will need to assign it using the &lt;- operator. Here is a (slightly) more advanced function: my.sum.2 &lt;- function(x, y , absolute=FALSE) { if(absolute==TRUE) { result &lt;- abs(x+y) } else{ result &lt;- x+y } result } my.sum.2(-10,2,TRUE) ## [1] 8 Things to note: if(condition){expression1} else{expression2} does just what the name suggests. The function will output its last evaluated expression. You don’t need to use the return function explicitly. Using absolute=FALSE sets the default value of absolute to FALSE. This is overridden if absolute is stated explicitly in the function call. An important behavior of R is the scoping rules. This refers to the way R seeks for variables used in functions. As a rule of thumb, R will first look for variables inside the function and if not found, will search for the variable values in outer environments5. Think of the next example. a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- 2 x &lt;- 3 scoping &lt;- function(a,b){ a+b+x } scoping(10,11) ## [1] 24 3.17 Looping The real power of scripting is when repeated operations are done by iteration. R supports the usual for, while, and repated loops. Here is an embarrassingly simple example for (i in 1:5){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 A slightly more advanced example, is vector multiplication result &lt;- 0 n &lt;- 1e3 x &lt;- 1:n y &lt;- (1:n)/n for(i in 1:n){ result &lt;- result+ x[i]*y[i] } Remark. Vector Operations: You should NEVER write your own vector and matrix products like in the previous example. Only use existing facilities such as %*%, sum(), etc. Remark. Parallel Operations: If you already know that you will be needing to parallelize your work, get used to working with foreach loops in the foreach package, rather then regular for loops. 3.18 Apply For applying the same function to a set of elements, there is no need to write an explicit loop. This is such en elementary operation that every programming language will provide some facility to apply, or map the function to all elements of a set. R provides several facilities to perform this. The most basic of which is lapply which applies a function over all elements of a list, and return a list of outputs: the.list &lt;- list(1,&#39;a&#39;,mean) # a list of 3 elements from different calsses lapply(X = the.list, FUN = class) # apply the function `class` to each elements ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## ## [[3]] ## [1] &quot;standardGeneric&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;methods&quot; sapply(X = the.list, FUN = class) # lapply with cleaned output ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;character&quot; &quot;standardGeneric&quot; R provides many variations on lapply to facilitate programming. Here is a partial list: sapply: The same as lapply but tries to arrange output in a vector or matrix, and not an unstructured list. vapply: A safer version of sapply, where the output class is pre-specified. apply: For applying over the rows or columns of matrices. mapply: For applying functions with more than a single input. tapply: For splitting vectors and applying functions on subsets. rapply: A recursive version of lapply. eapply: Like lapply, only operates on environments instead of lists. Map+Reduce: For a Common Lisp look and feel of lapply. parallel::parLapply: A parallel version of lapply from the package parallel. parallel::parLBapply: A parallel version of lapply, with load balancing from the package parallel. 3.19 Recursion The R compiler is really not designed for recursion, and you will rarely need to do so. See the RCpp Chapter 19 for linking C code, which is better suited for recursion. If you really insist to write recursions in R, make sure to use the Recall function, which, as the name suggests, recalls the function in which it is place. Here is a demonstration with the Fibonacci series. fib&lt;-function(n) { if (n &lt; 2) fn&lt;-1 else fn &lt;- Recall(n - 1) + Recall(n - 2) return(fn) } fib(5) ## [1] 8 3.20 Dates and Times [TODO. In the meanwhile, see the lubridate pacakge]. 3.21 Bibliographic Notes There are endlessly many introductory texts on R. For a list of free resources see CrossValidated. I personally recommend the official introduction Venables et al. (2004), available online, or anything else Bill Venables writes. For Importing and Exporting see (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html). For working with databases see (https://rforanalytics.wordpress.com/useful-links-for-r/odbc-databases-for-r/). For advanced R programming see Wickham (2014), available online, or anything else Hadley Wickham writes. For a curated list of recommended packages see here. 3.22 Practice Yourself Load the package MASS. That was easy. Now load ggplot2, after looking into install.pacakges(). Save the numbers 1 to 1,000,000 (1e6) into an object named object. Write a function that computes the mean of its input. Write a version that uses sum(), and another that uses a for loop and the summation +. Try checking which is faster using system.time. Is the difference considerable? Ask me about it in class. Write a function that returns TRUE if a number is divisible by 13, FALSE if not, and a nice warning to the user if the input is not an integer number. Apply the previous function to all the numbers in object. Try using a for loop, but also a mapping/apply function. Make a matrix of random numbers using A &lt;- matrix(rnorm(40), ncol=10, nrow=4). Compute the mean of each columns. Do it using your own loop and then do the same with lapply or apply. Make a data frame (dataA) with three columns, and 100 rows. The first column with 100 numbers generated from the \\(\\mathcal{N}(10,1)\\) distribution, second column with samples from \\(Poiss(\\lambda=4)\\). The third column contains only 1. Make another data frame (dataB) with three columns and 100 rows. Now with \\(\\mathcal{N}(10,0.5^2)\\), \\(Poiss(\\lambda=4)\\) and 2. Combine the two data frames into an object named dataAB with rbind. Make a scatter plot of dataAB where the x-axes is the first column, the y-axes is the second and define the shape of the points to be the third column. In a sample generated of 1,000 observations from the \\(\\mathcal{N}(10,1)\\) distribution: What is the proportion of samples smaller than \\(12.4\\) ? What is the \\(0.23\\) percentile of the sample? References "],
["eda.html", "Chapter 4 Exploratory Data Analysis 4.1 Summary Statistics 4.2 Visualization 4.3 Mixed Type Data 4.4 Bibliographic Notes 4.5 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 4 Exploratory Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a term coined by John W. Tukey in his seminal book (Tukey 1977). It is also (arguably) known as Visual Analytics, or Descriptive Statistics. It is the practice of inspecting, and exploring your data, before stating hypotheses, fitting predictors, and other more ambitious inferential goals. It typically includes the computation of simple summary statistics which capture some property of interest in the data, and visualization. EDA can be thought of as an assumption free, purely algorithmic practice. In this text we present EDA techniques along the following lines: How we explore: with summary-statistics, or visually? How many variables analyzed simultaneously: univariate, bivariate, or multivariate? What type of variable: categorical or continuous? 4.1 Summary Statistics 4.1.1 Categorical Data Categorical variables do not admit any mathematical operations on them. We cannot sum them, or even sort them. We can only count them. As such, summaries of categorical variables will always start with the counting of the frequency of each category. 4.1.1.1 Summary of Univariate Categorical Data # Make some data gender &lt;- c(rep(&#39;Boy&#39;, 10), rep(&#39;Girl&#39;, 12)) drink &lt;- c(rep(&#39;Coke&#39;, 5), rep(&#39;Sprite&#39;, 3), rep(&#39;Coffee&#39;, 6), rep(&#39;Tea&#39;, 7), rep(&#39;Water&#39;, 1)) age &lt;- sample(c(&#39;Young&#39;, &#39;Old&#39;), size = length(gender), replace = TRUE) # Count frequencies table(gender) ## gender ## Boy Girl ## 10 12 table(drink) ## drink ## Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## 6 5 3 7 1 table(age) ## age ## Old Young ## 11 11 If instead of the level counts you want the proportions, you can use prop.table prop.table(table(gender)) ## gender ## Boy Girl ## 0.4545455 0.5454545 4.1.1.2 Summary of Bivariate Categorical Data library(magrittr) cbind(gender, drink) %&gt;% head # bind vectors into matrix and inspect ## gender drink ## [1,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Coke&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Coke&quot; ## [3,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Coke&quot; ## [4,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Coke&quot; ## [5,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Coke&quot; ## [6,] &quot;Boy&quot; &quot;Sprite&quot; table1 &lt;- table(gender, drink) # count frequencies of bivariate combinations table1 ## drink ## gender Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## Boy 2 5 3 0 0 ## Girl 4 0 0 7 1 4.1.1.3 Summary of Multivariate Categorical Data You may be wondering how does R handle tables with more than two dimensions. It is indeed not trivial to report this in a human-readable way. R offers several solutions: table is easier to compute with, and ftable is human readable. table2.1 &lt;- table(gender, drink, age) # A machine readable table. table2.1 ## , , age = Old ## ## drink ## gender Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## Boy 1 2 1 0 0 ## Girl 3 0 0 3 1 ## ## , , age = Young ## ## drink ## gender Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## Boy 1 3 2 0 0 ## Girl 1 0 0 4 0 table.2.2 &lt;- ftable(gender, drink, age) # A human readable table. table.2.2 ## age Old Young ## gender drink ## Boy Coffee 1 1 ## Coke 2 3 ## Sprite 1 2 ## Tea 0 0 ## Water 0 0 ## Girl Coffee 3 1 ## Coke 0 0 ## Sprite 0 0 ## Tea 3 4 ## Water 1 0 If you want proportions instead of counts, you need to specify the denominator, i.e., the margins. Think: what is the margin in each of the following outputs? prop.table(table1, margin = 1) ## drink ## gender Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## Boy 0.20000000 0.50000000 0.30000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 ## Girl 0.33333333 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.58333333 0.08333333 prop.table(table1, margin = 2) ## drink ## gender Coffee Coke Sprite Tea Water ## Boy 0.3333333 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## Girl 0.6666667 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 4.1.2 Continous Data Continuous variables admit many more operations than categorical. We can compute sums, means, quantiles, and more. 4.1.2.1 Summary of Univariate Continuous Data We distinguish between several types of summaries, each capturing a different property of the data. 4.1.2.2 Summary of Location Capture the “location” of the data. These include: Definition 4.1 (Average) The mean, or average, of a sample \\(x:=(x_1,\\dots,x_n)\\), denoted \\(\\bar x\\) is defined as \\[ \\bar x := n^{-1} \\sum x_i. \\] The sample mean is non robust. A single large observation may inflate the mean indefinitely. For this reason, we define several other summaries of location, which are more robust, i.e., less affected by “contaminations” of the data. We start by defining the sample quantiles, themselves not a summary of location. Definition 4.2 (Quantiles) The \\(\\alpha\\) quantile of a sample \\(x\\), denoted \\(x_\\alpha\\), is (non uniquely) defined as a value above \\(100 \\alpha \\%\\) of the sample, and below \\(100 (1-\\alpha) \\%\\). We emphasize that sample quantiles are non-uniquely defined. See ?quantile for the 9(!) different definitions that R provides. Using the sample quantiles, we can now define another summary of location, the median. Definition 4.3 (Median) The median of a sample \\(x\\), denoted \\(x_{0.5}\\) is the \\(\\alpha=0.5\\) quantile of the sample. A whole family of summaries of locations is the alpha trimmed mean. Definition 4.4 (Alpha Trimmed Mean) The \\(\\alpha\\) trimmed mean of a sample \\(x\\), denoted \\(\\bar x_\\alpha\\) is the average of the sample after removing the \\(\\alpha\\) proportion of largest and \\(\\alpha\\) proportion of smallest observations. The simple mean and median are instances of the alpha trimmed mean: \\(\\bar x_0\\) and \\(\\bar x_{0.5}\\) respectively. Here are the R implementations: x &lt;- rexp(100) # generate some random data mean(x) # simple mean ## [1] 1.088972 median(x) # median ## [1] 0.7839536 mean(x, trim = 0.2) # alpha trimmed mean with alpha=0.2 ## [1] 0.8199521 4.1.2.3 Summary of Scale The scale of the data, sometimes known as spread, can be thought of its variability. Definition 4.5 (Standard Deviation) The standard deviation of a sample \\(x\\), denoted \\(S(x)\\), is defined as \\[ S(x):=\\sqrt{(n-1)^{-1} \\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2} . \\] For reasons of robustness, we define other, more robust, measures of scale. Definition 4.6 (MAD) The Median Absolute Deviation from the median, denoted as \\(MAD(x)\\), is defined as \\[MAD(x):= c \\: |x-x_{0.5}|_{0.5} . \\] where \\(c\\) is some constant, typically set to \\(c=1.4826\\) so that MAD and \\(S(x)\\) have the same large sample limit. Definition 4.7 (IQR) The Inter Quantile Range of a sample \\(x\\), denoted as \\(IQR(x)\\), is defined as \\[ IQR(x):= x_{0.75}-x_{0.25} .\\] Here are the R implementations sd(x) # standard deviation ## [1] 1.068415 mad(x) # MAD ## [1] 0.7083485 IQR(x) # IQR ## [1] 0.9869843 4.1.2.4 Summary of Asymmetry Summaries of asymmetry, also known as skewness, quantify the departure of the \\(x\\) from a symmetric sample. Definition 4.8 (Yule) The Yule measure of assymetry, denoted \\(Yule(x)\\) is defined as \\[Yule(x) := \\frac{1/2 \\: (x_{0.75}+x_{0.25}) - x_{0.5} }{1/2 \\: IQR(x)} .\\] Here is an R implementation yule &lt;- function(x){ numerator &lt;- 0.5 * (quantile(x,0.75) + quantile(x,0.25))-median(x) denominator &lt;- 0.5* IQR(x) c(numerator/denominator, use.names=FALSE) } yule(x) ## [1] 0.2317222 4.1.2.5 Summary of Bivariate Continuous Data When dealing with bivariate, or multivariate data, we can obviously compute univariate summaries for each variable separately. This is not the topic of this section, in which we want to summarize the association between the variables, and not within them. Definition 4.9 (Covariance) The covariance between two samples, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), of same length \\(n\\), is defined as \\[Cov(x,y):= (n-1)^{-1} \\sum (x_i-\\bar x)(y_i-\\bar y) \\] We emphasize this is not the covariance you learned about in probability classes, since it is not the covariance between two random variables but rather, between two samples. For this reasons, some authors call it the empirical covariance, or sample covariance. Definition 4.10 (Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient) Peasrson’s correlation coefficient, a.k.a. Pearson’s moment product correlation, or simply, the correlation, denoted r(x,y), is defined as \\[r(x,y):=\\frac{Cov(x,y)}{S(x)S(y)}. \\] If you find this definition enigmatic, just think of the correlation as the covariance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) after transforming each to the unitless scale of z-scores. Definition 4.11 (Z-Score) The z-scores of a sample \\(x\\) are defined as the mean-centered, scale normalized observations: \\[z_i(x):= \\frac{x_i-\\bar x}{S(x)}.\\] We thus have that \\(r(x,y)=Cov(z(x),z(y))\\). 4.1.2.6 Summary of Multivariate Continuous Data The covariance is a simple summary of association between two variables, but it certainly may not capture the whole “story” when dealing with more than two variables. The most common summary of multivariate relation, is the covariance matrix, but we warn that only the simplest multivariate relations are fully summarized by this matrix. Definition 4.12 (Sample Covariance Matrix) Given \\(n\\) observations on \\(p\\) variables, denote \\(x_{i,j}\\) the \\(i\\)’th observation of the \\(j\\)’th variable. The sample covariance matrix, denoted \\(\\hat \\Sigma\\) is defined as \\[\\hat \\Sigma_{k,l}=(n-1)^{-1} \\sum_i [(x_{i,k}-\\bar x_k)(x_{i,l}-\\bar x_l)],\\] where \\(\\bar x_k:=n^{-1} \\sum_i x_{i,k}\\). Put differently, the \\(k,l\\)’th entry in \\(\\hat \\Sigma\\) is the sample covariance between variables \\(k\\) and \\(l\\). Remark. \\(\\hat \\Sigma\\) is clearly non robust. How would you define a robust covariance matrix? 4.2 Visualization Summarizing the information in a variable to a single number clearly conceals much of the story in the sample. This is akin to inspecting a person using a caricature, instead of a picture. Visualizing the data, when possible, is more informative. 4.2.1 Categorical Data Recalling that with categorical variables we can only count the frequency of each level, the plotting of such variables are typically variations on the bar plot. 4.2.1.1 Visualizing Univariate Categorical Data barplot(table(age)) 4.2.1.2 Visualizing Bivariate Categorical Data There are several generalizations of the barplot, aimed to deal with the visualization of bivariate categorical data. They are sometimes known as the clustered bar plot and the stacked bar plot. In this text, we advocate the use of the mosaic plot which is also the default in R. plot(table1, main=&#39;Bivariate mosaic plot&#39;) 4.2.1.3 Visualizing Multivariate Categorical Data The mosaic plot is not easy to generalize to more than two variables, but it is still possible (at the cost of interpretability). plot(table2.1, main=&#39;Trivaraite mosaic plot&#39;) 4.2.2 Continuous Data 4.2.2.1 Visualizing Univariate Continuous Data Unlike categorical variables, there are endlessly many way to visualize continuous variables. The simplest way is to look at the raw data via the stripchart. sample1 &lt;- rexp(10) stripchart(sample1) Clearly, if there are many observations, the stripchart will be a useless line of black dots. We thus bin them together, and look at the frequency of each bin; this is the histogram. R’s histogram function has very good defaults to choose the number of bins. Here is a histogram showing the counts of each bin. sample1 &lt;- rexp(100) hist(sample1, freq=T, main=&#39;Counts&#39;) The bin counts can be replaced with the proportion of each bin using the freq argument. hist(sample1, freq=F, main=&#39;Proportion&#39;) The bins of a histogram are non overlapping. We can adopt a sliding window approach, instead of binning. This is the density plot which is produced with the density function, and added to an existing plot with the lines function. The rug function adds the original data points as ticks on the axes, and is strongly recommended to detect artifacts introduced by the binning of the histogram, or the smoothing of the density plot. hist(sample1, freq=F, main=&#39;Frequencies&#39;) lines(density(sample1)) rug(sample1) Remark. Why would it make no sense to make a table, or a barplot, of continuous data? One particularly useful visualization, due to John W. Tukey, is the boxplot. The boxplot is designed to capture the main phenomena in the data, and simultaneously point to outlines. boxplot(sample1) 4.2.2.2 Visualizing Bivariate Continuous Data The bivariate counterpart of the stipchart is the celebrated scatter plot. n &lt;- 20 x1 &lt;- rexp(n) x2 &lt;- 2* x1 + 4 + rexp(n) plot(x2~x1) Like the univariate stripchart, the scatter plot will be an uninformative mess in the presence of a lot of data. A nice bivariate counterpart of the univariate histogram is the hexbin plot, which tessellates the plane with hexagons, and reports their frequencies. library(hexbin) # load required library n &lt;- 2e5 x1 &lt;- rexp(n) x2 &lt;- 2* x1 + 4 + rnorm(n) plot(hexbin(x = x1, y = x2)) 4.2.2.3 Visualizing Multivariate Continuous Data Visualizing multivariate data is a tremendous challenge given that we cannot grasp \\(4\\) dimensional spaces, nor can the computer screen present more than \\(2\\) dimensional spaces. We thus have several options: (i) To project the data to 2D. This is discussed in the Dimensionality Reduction Section 10.1. (ii) To visualize not the raw data, but rather its summaries, like the covariance matrix. Since the covariance matrix, \\(\\hat \\Sigma\\) is a matrix, it can be visualized as an image. Note the use of the :: operator, which is used to call a function from some package, without loading the whole package. We will use the :: operator when we want to emphasize the package of origin of a function. covariance &lt;- cov(longley) # The covariance of the longley dataset correlations &lt;- cor(longley) # The correlations of the longley dataset lattice::levelplot(correlations) 4.2.2.4 Parallel Coordinate Plots TODO 4.3 Mixed Type Data Most real data sets will be of mixed type: both categorical and continous. One approach to view such data, is to visualize the continous variables separatly, for each level of the categorical variables. There are, however, interesting dedicated visualization for such data. 4.3.1 Alluvian Diagram An Alluvian plot is a type of Parallel Coordinate for multivariate categorical data. It is particularly interesting when the \\(x\\) axis is a discretized time variable, and it is used to visualize flow. The following example, from the ggalluvial package Vignette by Jason Cory Brunson, demonstrates the flow of students between different majors, as semesters evolve. library(ggalluvial) data(majors) majors$curriculum &lt;- as.factor(majors$curriculum) ggplot(majors, aes(x = semester, stratum = curriculum, alluvium = student, fill = curriculum, label = curriculum)) + scale_fill_brewer(type = &quot;qual&quot;, palette = &quot;Set2&quot;) + geom_flow(stat = &quot;alluvium&quot;, lode.guidance = &quot;rightleft&quot;, color = &quot;darkgray&quot;) + geom_stratum() + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;student curricula across several semesters&quot;) Things to note: We used the galluvian package of the ggplot2 ecosystem. More on ggplot2 in the Plotting Chapter. Time is on the \\(x\\) axis. Categories are color coded. 4.4 Bibliographic Notes Like any other topic in this book, you can consult Venables and Ripley (2013). The seminal book on EDA, written long before R was around, is Tukey (1977). For an excellent text on robust statistics see Wilcox (2011). 4.5 Practice Yourself Read about the Titanic data set using ?Titanic. Inspect it with the table and with the ftable commands.

["lm.html", "Chapter 5 Linear Models 5.1 Problem Setup 5.2 OLS Estimation in R 5.3 Inference 5.4 Bibliographic Notes 5.5 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 5 Linear Models 5.1 Problem Setup Example 5.1 (Bottle Cap Production) Consider a randomized experiment designed to study the effects of temperature and pressure on the diameter of manufactured a bottle cap. Example 5.2 (Rental Prices) Consider the prediction of rental prices given an appartment’s attributes. Both examples require some statistical model, but they are very different. The first is a causal inference problem: we want to design an intervention so that we need to recover the causal effect of temperature and pressure. The second is a prediction problem, a.k.a. a forecasting problem, in which we don’t care about the causal effects, we just want good predictions. In this chapter we discuss the causal problem in Example 5.1. This means that when we assume a model, we assume it is the actual data generating process, i.e., we assume the sampling distribution is well specified. The second type of problems is discussed in the Supervised Learning Chapter 9. Here are some more examples of the types of problems we are discussing. Example 5.3 (Plant Growth) Consider the treatment of various plants with various fertilizers to study the fertilizer’s effect on growth. Example 5.4 (Return to Education) Consider the study of return to education by analyzing the incomes of individuals with different education years. Example 5.5 (Drug Effect) Consider the study of the effect of a new drug for hemophilia, by analyzing the level of blood coagulation after the administration of various amounts of the new drug. Let’s present the linear model. We assume that a response6 variable is the sum of effects of some factors7. Denoting the response variable by \\(y\\), the factors by \\(x=(x_1,\\dots,x_p)\\), and the effects by \\(\\beta:=(\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_p)\\) the linear model assumption implies that the expected response is the sum of the factors effects: \\[\\begin{align} E[y]=x_1 \\beta_1 + \\dots + x_p \\beta_p = \\sum_{j=1}^p x_j \\beta_j = x&#39;\\beta . \\tag{5.1} \\end{align}\\] Clearly, there may be other factors that affect the the caps’ diameters. We thus introduce an error term8, denoted by \\(\\varepsilon\\), to capture the effects of all unmodeled factors and measurement error9. The implied generative process of a sample of \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\) observations it thus \\[\\begin{align} y_i = x_i&#39;\\beta + \\varepsilon_i = \\sum_j x_{i,j} \\beta_j + \\varepsilon_i , i=1,\\dots,n . \\tag{5.2} \\end{align}\\] or in matrix notation \\[\\begin{align} y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon . \\tag{5.3} \\end{align}\\] Let’s demonstrate Eq.(5.2). In our cap example (5.1), assuming that pressure and temperature have two levels each (say, high and low), we would write \\(x_{i,1}=1\\) if the pressure of the \\(i\\)’th measurement was set to high, and \\(x_{i,1}=-1\\) if the pressure was set to low. Similarly, we would write \\(x_{i,2}=1\\), and \\(x_{i,2}=-1\\), if the temperature was set to high, or low, respectively. The coding with \\(\\{-1,1\\}\\) is known as effect coding. If you prefer coding with \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), this is known as dummy coding. The choice of coding has no real effect on the results, provided that you remember what coding you used when interpreting \\(\\hat \\beta\\). Remark. In Galton’s classical regression problem, where we try to seek the relation between the heights of sons and fathers then \\(p=1\\), \\(y_i\\) is the height of the \\(i\\)’th father, and \\(x_i\\) the height of the \\(i\\)’th son. There are many reasons linear models are very popular: Before the computer age, these were pretty much the only models that could actually be computed10. The whole Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) literature is an instance of linear models, that relies on sums of squares, which do not require a computer to work with. For purposes of prediction, where the actual data generating process is not of primary importance, they are popular because they simply work. Why is that? They are simple so that they do not require a lot of data to be computed. Put differently, they may be biased, but their variance is small enough to make them more accurate than other models. For non continuous predictors, any functional relation can be cast as a linear model. For the purpose of screening, where we only want to show the existence of an effect, and are less interested in the magnitude of that effect, a linear model is enough. If the true generative relation is not linear, but smooth enough, then the linear function is a good approximation via Taylor’s theorem. There are still two matters we have to attend: (i) How the estimate \\(\\beta\\)? (ii) How to perform inference? In the simplest linear models the estimation of \\(\\beta\\) is done using the method of least squares. A linear model with least squares estimation is known as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The OLS problem: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta:= argmin_\\beta \\{ \\sum_i (y_i-x_i&#39;\\beta)^2 \\}, \\tag{5.4} \\end{align}\\] and in matrix notation \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta:= argmin_\\beta \\{ \\Vert y-X\\beta \\Vert^2_2 \\}. \\tag{5.5} \\end{align}\\] Remark. Personally, I prefer the matrix notation because it is suggestive of the geometry of the problem. The reader is referred to Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2001), Section 3.2, for more on the geometry of OLS. Different software suits, and even different R packages, solve Eq.(5.4) in different ways so that we skip the details of how exactly it is solved. These are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18. The last matter we need to attend is how to do inference on \\(\\hat \\beta\\). For that, we will need some assumptions on \\(\\varepsilon\\). A typical set of assumptions is the following: Independence: we assume \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are independent of everything else. Think of them as the measurement error of an instrument: it is independent of the measured value and of previous measurements. Centered: we assume that \\(E[\\varepsilon]=0\\), meaning there is no systematic error, sometimes it called The “Linearity assumption”. Normality: we will typically assume that \\(\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)\\), but we will later see that this is not really required. We emphasize that these assumptions are only needed for inference on \\(\\hat \\beta\\) and not for the estimation itself, which is done by the purely algorithmic framework of OLS. Given the above assumptions, we can apply some probability theory and linear algebra to get the distribution of the estimation error: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta - \\beta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, (X&#39;X)^{-1} \\sigma^2). \\tag{5.6} \\end{align}\\] The reason I am not too strict about the normality assumption above, is that Eq.(5.6) is approximately correct even if \\(\\varepsilon\\) is not normal, provided that there are many more observations than factors (\\(n \\gg p\\)). 5.2 OLS Estimation in R We are now ready to estimate some linear models with R. We will use the whiteside data from the MASS package, recording the outside temperature and gas consumption, before and after an apartment’s insulation. library(MASS) # load the package library(data.table) # for some data manipulations data(whiteside) # load the data head(whiteside) # inspect the data ## Insul Temp Gas ## 1 Before -0.8 7.2 ## 2 Before -0.7 6.9 ## 3 Before 0.4 6.4 ## 4 Before 2.5 6.0 ## 5 Before 2.9 5.8 ## 6 Before 3.2 5.8 We do the OLS estimation on the pre-insulation data with lm function, possibly the most important function in R. whiteside &lt;- data.table(whiteside) lm.1 &lt;- lm(Gas~Temp, data=whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;]) # OLS estimation Things to note: We used the tilde syntax Gas~Temp, reading “gas as linear function of temperature”. The data argument tells R where to look for the variables Gas and Temp. We used Insul=='Before' to subset observations before the insulation. The result is assigned to the object lm.1. Like any other language, spoken or programable, there are many ways to say the same thing. Some more elegant than others… lm.1 &lt;- lm(y=Gas, x=Temp, data=whiteside[whiteside$Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,]) lm.1 &lt;- lm(y=whiteside[whiteside$Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,]$Gas,x=whiteside[whiteside$Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,]$Temp) lm.1 &lt;- whiteside[whiteside$Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,] %&gt;% lm(Gas~Temp, data=.) The output is an object of class lm. class(lm.1) ## [1] &quot;lm&quot; Objects of class lm are very complicated. They store a lot of information which may be used for inference, plotting, etc. The str function, short for “structure”, shows us the various elements of the object. str(lm.1) ## List of 12 ## $ coefficients : Named num [1:2] 6.854 -0.393 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## $ residuals : Named num [1:26] 0.0316 -0.2291 -0.2965 0.1293 0.0866 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:26] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## $ effects : Named num [1:26] -24.2203 -5.6485 -0.2541 0.1463 0.0988 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:26] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; ... ## $ rank : int 2 ## $ fitted.values: Named num [1:26] 7.17 7.13 6.7 5.87 5.71 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:26] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## $ assign : int [1:2] 0 1 ## $ qr :List of 5 ## ..$ qr : num [1:26, 1:2] -5.099 0.196 0.196 0.196 0.196 ... ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. ..$ : chr [1:26] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... ## .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;(Intercept)&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;assign&quot;)= int [1:2] 0 1 ## ..$ qraux: num [1:2] 1.2 1.35 ## ..$ pivot: int [1:2] 1 2 ## ..$ tol : num 1e-07 ## ..$ rank : int 2 ## ..- attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;qr&quot; ## $ df.residual : int 24 ## $ xlevels : Named list() ## $ call : language lm(formula = Gas ~ Temp, data = whiteside[Insul == &quot;Before&quot;]) ## $ terms :Classes &#39;terms&#39;, &#39;formula&#39; language Gas ~ Temp ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;variables&quot;)= language list(Gas, Temp) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;factors&quot;)= int [1:2, 1] 0 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;Gas&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. .. .. ..$ : chr &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;term.labels&quot;)= chr &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;order&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;intercept&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;response&quot;)= int 1 ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;predvars&quot;)= language list(Gas, Temp) ## .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dataClasses&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;Gas&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## $ model :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 26 obs. of 2 variables: ## ..$ Gas : num [1:26] 7.2 6.9 6.4 6 5.8 5.8 5.6 4.7 5.8 5.2 ... ## ..$ Temp: num [1:26] -0.8 -0.7 0.4 2.5 2.9 3.2 3.6 3.9 4.2 4.3 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;terms&quot;)=Classes &#39;terms&#39;, &#39;formula&#39; language Gas ~ Temp ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;variables&quot;)= language list(Gas, Temp) ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;factors&quot;)= int [1:2, 1] 0 1 ## .. .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] &quot;Gas&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;term.labels&quot;)= chr &quot;Temp&quot; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;order&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;intercept&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;response&quot;)= int 1 ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;predvars&quot;)= language list(Gas, Temp) ## .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;dataClasses&quot;)= Named chr [1:2] &quot;numeric&quot; &quot;numeric&quot; ## .. .. .. ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;Gas&quot; &quot;Temp&quot; ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;lm&quot; In RStudio it is particularly easy to extract objects. Just write your.object$ and press tab after the $ for autocompletion. If we only want \\(\\hat \\beta\\), it can also be extracted with the coef function. coef(lm.1) ## (Intercept) Temp ## 6.8538277 -0.3932388 Things to note: R automatically adds an (Intercept) term. This means we estimate \\(Gas=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Temp + \\varepsilon\\) and not \\(Gas=\\beta_1 Temp + \\varepsilon\\). This makes sense because we are interested in the contribution of the temperature to the variability of the gas consumption about its mean, and not about zero. The effect of temperature, i.e., \\(\\hat \\beta_1\\), is -0.39. The negative sign means that the higher the temperature, the less gas is consumed. The magnitude of the coefficient means that for a unit increase in the outside temperature, the gas consumption decreases by 0.39 units. We can use the predict function to make predictions, but we emphasize that if the purpose of the model is to make predictions, and not interpret coefficients, better skip to the Supervised Learning Chapter 9. plot(predict(lm.1)~whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,Gas]) abline(0,1, lty=2) The model seems to fit the data nicely. A common measure of the goodness of fit is the coefficient of determination, more commonly known as the \\(R^2\\). Definition 5.1 (R2) The coefficient of determination, denoted \\(R^2\\), is defined as \\[\\begin{align} R^2:= 1-\\frac{\\sum_i (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2}{\\sum_i (y_i - \\bar y)^2}, \\end{align}\\] where \\(\\hat y_i\\) is the model’s prediction, \\(\\hat y_i = x_i \\hat \\beta\\). It can be easily computed R2 &lt;- function(y, y.hat){ numerator &lt;- (y-y.hat)^2 %&gt;% sum denominator &lt;- (y-mean(y))^2 %&gt;% sum 1-numerator/denominator } R2(y=whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,Gas], y.hat=predict(lm.1)) ## [1] 0.9438081 This is a nice result implying that about \\(94\\%\\) of the variability in gas consumption can be attributed to changes in the outside temperature. Obviously, R does provide the means to compute something as basic as \\(R^2\\), but I will let you find it for yourselves. 5.3 Inference To perform inference on \\(\\hat \\beta\\), in order to test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals, we need to quantify the uncertainly in the reported \\(\\hat \\beta\\). This is exactly what Eq.(5.6) gives us. Luckily, we don’t need to manipulate multivariate distributions manually, and everything we need is already implemented. The most important function is summary which gives us an overview of the model’s fit. We emphasize that that fitting a model with lm is an assumption free algorithmic step. Inference using summary is not assumption free, and requires the set of assumptions leading to Eq.(5.6). summary(lm.1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Gas ~ Temp, data = whiteside[Insul == &quot;Before&quot;]) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.62020 -0.19947 0.06068 0.16770 0.59778 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The \\(R^2\\) is reported at the bottom. The “Adjusted R-squared” is a variation that compensates for the model’s complexity. The original call to lm is saved in the Call section. Some summary statistics of the residuals (\\(y_i-\\hat y_i\\)) in the Residuals section. The “residuals standard error”11 is \\(\\sqrt{(n-p)^{-1} \\sum_i (y_i-\\hat y_i)^2}\\). The denominator of this expression is the degrees of freedom, \\(n-p\\), which can be thought of as the hardness of the problem. As the name suggests, summary is merely a summary. The full summary(lm.1) object is a monstrous object. Its various elements can be queried using str(sumary(lm.1)). Can we check the assumptions required for inference? Some. Let’s start with the linearity assumption. If we were wrong, and the data is not arranged about a linear line, the residuals will have some shape. We thus plot the residuals as a function of the predictor to diagnose shape. plot(residuals(lm.1)~whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,Temp]) abline(0,0, lty=2) I can’t say I see any shape. Let’s fit a wrong model, just to see what “shape” means. lm.1.1 &lt;- lm(Gas~I(Temp^2), data=whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,]) plot(residuals(lm.1.1)~whiteside[Insul==&#39;Before&#39;,Temp]); abline(0,0, lty=2) Things to note: We used I(Temp)^2 to specify the model \\(Gas=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Temp^2+ \\varepsilon\\). The residuals have a “belly”. Because they are not a cloud around the linear trend, and we have the wrong model. To the next assumption. We assumed \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are independent of everything else. The residuals, \\(y_i-\\hat y_i\\) can be thought of a sample of \\(\\varepsilon_i\\). When diagnosing the linearity assumption, we already saw their distribution does not vary with the \\(x\\)’s, Temp in our case. They may be correlated with themselves; a positive departure from the model, may be followed by a series of positive departures etc. Diagnosing these auto-correlations is a real art, which is not part of our course. The last assumption we required is normality. As previously stated, if \\(n \\gg p\\), this assumption can be relaxed. If \\(n\\) is in the order of \\(p\\), we need to verify this assumption. My favorite tool for this task is the qqplot. A qqplot compares the quantiles of the sample with the respective quantiles of the assumed distribution. If quantiles align along a line, the assumed distribution if OK. If quantiles depart from a line, then the assumed distribution does not fit the sample. qqnorm(resid(lm.1)) Things to note: The qqnorm function plots a qqplot against a normal distribution. For non-normal distributions try qqplot. resid(lm.1) extracts the residuals from the linear model, i.e., the vector of \\(y_i-x_i&#39;\\hat \\beta\\). Judging from the figure, the normality assumption is quite plausible. Let’s try the same on a non-normal sample, namely a uniformly distributed sample, to see how that would look. qqnorm(runif(100)) 5.3.1 Testing a Hypothesis on a Single Coefficient The first inferential test we consider is a hypothesis test on a single coefficient. In our gas example, we may want to test that the temperature has no effect on the gas consumption. The answer for that is given immediately by summary(lm.1) summary.lm1 &lt;- summary(lm.1) coefs.lm1 &lt;- summary.lm1$coefficients coefs.lm1 ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 6.8538277 0.11842341 57.87561 2.717533e-27 ## Temp -0.3932388 0.01958601 -20.07754 1.640469e-16 We see that the p-value for \\(H_{0,1}:\\hat \\beta_1=0\\) against a two sided alternative is effectively 0, so that \\(\\beta_1\\) is unlikely to be \\(0\\). 5.3.2 Constructing a Confidence Interval on a Single Coefficient Since the summary function gives us the standard errors of \\(\\hat \\beta\\), we can immediately compute \\(\\hat \\beta_j \\pm 2 \\sqrt{Var[\\hat \\beta_j]}\\) to get ourselves a (roughly) \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval. In our example the interval is coefs.lm1[2,1] + c(-2,2) * coefs.lm1[2,2] ## [1] -0.4324108 -0.3540668 5.3.3 Multiple Regression Remark. Multiple regression is not to be confused with multivariate regression discussed in Chapter 8. The swiss dataset encodes the fertility at each of Switzerland’s 47 French speaking provinces, along other socio-economic indicators. Let’s see if these are statistically related: head(swiss) ## Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic ## Courtelary 80.2 17.0 15 12 9.96 ## Delemont 83.1 45.1 6 9 84.84 ## Franches-Mnt 92.5 39.7 5 5 93.40 ## Moutier 85.8 36.5 12 7 33.77 ## Neuveville 76.9 43.5 17 15 5.16 ## Porrentruy 76.1 35.3 9 7 90.57 ## Infant.Mortality ## Courtelary 22.2 ## Delemont 22.2 ## Franches-Mnt 20.2 ## Moutier 20.3 ## Neuveville 20.6 ## Porrentruy 26.6 lm.5 &lt;- lm(data=swiss, Fertility~Agriculture+Examination+Education+Education+Catholic+Infant.Mortality) summary(lm.5) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Fertility ~ Agriculture + Examination + Education + ## Education + Catholic + Infant.Mortality, data = swiss) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -15.2743 -5.2617 0.5032 4.1198 15.3213 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The summary of the model now reports the estimated effect, i.e., the regression coefficient, of each of the variables. Clearly, naming each variable explicitely is a tedios task if there are many. The use of Fertility~. in the next example reads: “Fertility as a function of all other variables in the swiss data.frame”. lm.5 &lt;- lm(data=swiss, Fertility~.) summary(lm.5) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Fertility ~ ., data = swiss) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -15.2743 -5.2617 0.5032 4.1198 15.3213 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The stress reduction values are represented on a scale that ranges from 1 to 10. The values represent how effective the treatment programs were at reducing participant’s stress levels, with larger effects indicating higher effectiveness. twoWay &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/dataset_anova_twoWay_comparisons.csv&#39;) head(twoWay) ## Treatment Age StressReduction ## 1 mental young 10 ## 2 mental young 9 ## 3 mental young 8 ## 4 mental mid 7 ## 5 mental mid 6 ## 6 mental mid 5 How many observations per group? table(twoWay$Treatment, twoWay$Age) ## ## mid old young ## medical 3 3 3 ## mental 3 3 3 ## physical 3 3 3 Since we have two factorial predictors, this multiple regression is nothing but a two way ANOVA.

All the (main) effects and the intercept seem to be significant. The data has 2 factors, but the coefficients table has 4 predictors. This is because lm noticed that Treatment and Age are factors. Each level of each factor is thus encoded as a different (dummy) variable. The numerical values of the factors are meaningless. Instead, R has constructed a dummy variable for each level of each factor. The names of the effect are a concatenation of the factor’s name, and its level. You can inspect these dummy variables with the model.matrix command. model.matrix(lm.2) %&gt;% lattice::levelplot() If you don’t want the default dummy coding, look at ?contrasts. If you are more familiar with the ANOVA literature, or that you don’t want the effects of each level separately, but rather, the effect of all the levels of each factor, use the anova command. anova(lm.2) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Response: StressReduction ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Treatment 2 18 9.000 11 0.0004883 *** ## Age 2 162 81.000 99 1e-11 *** ## Residuals 22 18 0.818 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Things to note: The ANOVA table, unlike the summary function, tests if any of the levels of a factor has an effect, and not one level at a time. The significance of each factor is computed using an F-test. The degrees of freedom, encoding the number of levels of a factor, is given in the Df column. The StressReduction seems to vary for different ages and treatments, since both factors are significant. If you are extremely more comfortable with the ANOVA literature, you could have replaced the lm command with the aov command all along. lm.2.2 &lt;- aov(StressReduction~.,data=twoWay) class(lm.2.2) ## [1] &quot;aov&quot; &quot;lm&quot; summary(lm.2.2) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## Treatment 2 18 9.00 11 0.000488 *** ## Age 2 162 81.00 99 1e-11 *** ## Residuals 22 18 0.82 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Things to note: The lm function has been replaced with an aov function. The output of aov is an aov class object, which extends the lm class. The summary of an aov does not like the summary of an lm object, but rather, like an ANOVA table. As in any two-way ANOVA, we may want to ask if different age groups respond differently to different treatments. In the statistical parlance, this is called an interaction, or more precisely, an interaction of order 2. lm.3 &lt;- lm(StressReduction~Treatment+Age+Treatment:Age-1,data=twoWay) The syntax StressReduction~Treatment+Age+Treatment:Age-1 tells R to include main effects of Treatment, Age, and their interactions. Here are other ways to specify the same model. lm.3 &lt;- lm(StressReduction ~ Treatment * Age - 1,data=twoWay) lm.3 &lt;- lm(StressReduction~(.)^2 - 1,data=twoWay) The syntax Treatment * Age means “mains effects with second order interactions”.

This is because when allowing a different average response for every \\(Treatment*Age\\) combination, we are effectively estimating \\(3*3=9\\) cell means, even if they are not parametrized as cell means, but rather as main effect and interactions. The interactions do not seem to be significant. The assumptions required for inference are clearly not met in this example, which is there just to demonstrate R’s capabilities. Asking if all the interactions are significant, is asking if the different age groups have the same response to different treatments. Can we answer that based on the various interactions? We might, but it is possible that no single interaction is significant, while the combination is. To test for all the interactions together, we can simply check if the model without interactions is (significantly) better than a model with interactions. I.e., compare lm.2 to lm.3. This is done with the anova command. anova(lm.2,lm.3, test=&#39;F&#39;) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: StressReduction ~ Treatment + Age ## Model 2: StressReduction ~ Treatment + Age + Treatment:Age - 1 ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 22 18 ## 2 18 18 4 -3.5527e-15 We see that lm.3 is not (significantly) better than lm.2, so that we can conclude that there are no interactions: different ages have the same response to different treatments. 5.3.5 Testing a Hypothesis on a Single Contrast (*) Returning to the model without interactions, lm.2. coef(summary(lm.2)) ## Estimate Std.

It is possible that all treatments actually have the same effect. Comparing the effects of factor levels is called a contrast. Let’s test if the medical treatment, has in fact, the same effect as the physical treatment. library(multcomp) my.contrast &lt;- matrix(c(-1,0,1,0,0), nrow = 1) lm.4 &lt;- glht(lm.2, linfct=my.contrast) summary(lm.4) ## ## Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses ## ## Fit: lm(formula = StressReduction ~ ., data = twoWay) ## ## Linear Hypotheses: ## Estimate Std.

In our example \\(H_0:\\beta_1-\\beta_3=0\\), which justifies the construction of my.contrast. We used the glht function (generalized linear hypothesis test) from the package multcompt. The contrast is significant, i.e., the effect of a medical treatment, is different than that of a physical treatment. 5.4 Bibliographic Notes Like any other topic in this book, you can consult Venables and Ripley (2013) for more on linear models. For the theory of linear models, I like Greene (2003). 5.5 Practice Yourself Inspect women’s heights and weights with ?women. What is the change in weight per unit change in height? Use the lm function. Is the relation of height on weight significant? Use summary. Plot the residuals of the linear model with plot and resid. Plot the predictions of the model using abline. Inspect the normality of residuals using qqnorm. Inspect the design matrix using model.matrix. Write a function that takes an lm class object, and returns the confidence interval on the first coefficient. Apply it on the height and weight data. Use the ANOVA function to test the significance of the effect of height. Read about the “mtcars” dataset using ? mtcars.Inspect the dependency of the fuel consumption (mpg) in the weight (wt) and the 1/4 mile time (qsec). Make a pairs scatter plot with plot(mtcars[,c(&quot;mpg&quot;,&quot;wt&quot;,&quot;qsec&quot;)]) Does the connection look linear? Fit a multiple linear regression with lm. Call it model1. Try to add the transmission (am) as independent variable. Let R know this is a categorical variable with factor(am). Call it model2. Compare the “Adjusted R-squared” measure of the two models (we can’t use the regular R2 to compare two models with a different number of variables). Do the coefficients significant? Inspect the normality of residuals and the linearity assumptions. Now Inspect the hypothesis that the effect of weight is different between the transmission types with adding interaction to the model wt*factor(am). According to this model, what is the addition of one unit of weight in a manual transmission to the fuel consumption (-2.973-4.141=-7.11)? References "],
["glm.html", "Chapter 6 Generalized Linear Models 6.1 Problem Setup 6.2 Logistic Regression 6.3 Poisson Regression 6.4 Extensions 6.5 Bibliographic Notes 6.6 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 6 Generalized Linear Models Example 6.1 Consider the relation between cigarettes smoked, and the occurance of lung cancer. Do we expect the probability of cancer to be linear in the number of cigarettes? Probably not. Do we expect the variability of events to be constant about the trend? Probably not. Example 6.2 Consider the relation between the travel times to the distance travelled. Do you agree that the longer the distance travelled, then not only the travel times get longer, but they also get more variable? 6.1 Problem Setup In the Linear Models Chapter 5, we assumed the generative process to be linear in the effects of the predictors \\(x\\). We now write that same linear model, slightly differently: \\[ y|x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x&#39;\\beta, \\sigma^2). \\] This model not allow for the non-linear relations of Example 6.1, nor does it allow for the distrbituion of \\(\\varepsilon\\) to change with \\(x\\), as in Example 6.2. Generalize linear models (GLM), as the name suggests, are a generalization of the linear models in Chapter 5 that allow that13. For Example 6.1, we would like something in the lines of \\[ y|x \\sim Binom(1,p(x)) \\] For Example 6.2, we would like something in the lines of \\[ y|x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x&#39;\\beta,\\sigma^2(x)), \\] or more generally \\[ y|x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x),\\sigma^2(x)), \\] or maybe not Gaussian \\[ y|x \\sim Pois(\\lambda(x)). \\] Even more generally, for some distribution \\(F(\\theta)\\), with a parameter \\(\\theta\\), we would like to assume that the data is generated via \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{6.1} y|x \\sim F(\\theta(x)) \\end{align}\\] Possible examples include \\[\\begin{align} y|x &amp;\\sim Poisson(\\lambda(x)) \\\\ y|x &amp;\\sim Exp(\\lambda(x)) \\\\ y|x &amp;\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu(x),\\sigma^2(x)) \\end{align}\\] GLMs allow models of the type of Eq.(6.1), while imposing some constraints on \\(F\\) and on the relation \\(\\theta(x)\\). GLMs assume the data distribution \\(F\\) to be in a “well-behaved” family known as the Natural Exponential Family of distributions. This family includes the Gaussian, Gamma, Binomial, Poisson, and Negative Binomial distributions. These five include as special cases the exponential, chi-squared, Rayleigh, Weibull, Bernoulli, and geometric distributions. GLMs also assume that the distribution’s parameter, \\(\\theta\\), is some simple function of a linear combination of the effects. In our cigarettes example this amounts to assuming that each cigarette has an additive effect, but not on the probability of cancer, but rather, on some simple function of it. Formally \\[g(\\theta(x))=x&#39;\\beta,\\] and we recall that \\[x&#39;\\beta=\\beta_0 + \\sum_j x_j \\beta_j.\\] The function \\(g\\) is called the link function, its inverse, \\(g^{-1}\\) is the mean function. We thus say that “the effects of each cigarette is linear in link scale”. This terminology will later be required to understand R’s output. 6.2 Logistic Regression The best known of the GLM class of models is the logistic regression that deals with Binomial, or more precisely, Bernoulli-distributed data. The link function in the logistic regression is the logit function \\[\\begin{align} g(t)=log\\left( \\frac{t}{(1-t)} \\right) \\tag{6.2} \\end{align}\\] implying that under the logistic model assumptions \\[\\begin{align} y|x \\sim Binom \\left( 1, p=\\frac{e^{x&#39;\\beta}}{1+e^{x&#39;\\beta}} \\right). \\tag{6.3} \\end{align}\\] Before we fit such a model, we try to justify this construction, in particular, the enigmatic link function in Eq.(6.2). Let’s look at the simplest possible case: the comparison of two groups indexed by \\(x\\): \\(x=0\\) for the first, and \\(x=1\\) for the second. We start with some definitions. Definition 6.1 (Odds) The odds, of a binary random variable, \\(y\\), is defined as \\[\\frac{P(y=1)}{P(y=0)}.\\] Odds are the same as probabilities, but instead of telling me there is a \\(66\\%\\) of success, they tell me the odds of success are “2 to 1”. If you ever placed a bet, the language of “odds” should not be unfamiliar to you. Definition 6.2 (Odds Ratio) The odds ratio between two binary random variables, \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\), is defined as the ratio between their odds. Formally: \\[OR(y_1,y_2):=\\frac{P(y_1=1)/P(y_1=0)}{P(y_2=1)/P(y_2=0)}.\\] Odds ratios (OR) compare between the probabilities of two groups, only that it does not compare them in probability scale, but rather in odds scale. You can also think of ORs as a measure of distance between two Brenoulli distributions. ORs have better mathematical properties than other candidate distance measures, such as \\(P(y_1=1)-P(y_2=1)\\). Under the logit link assumption formalized in Eq.(6.3), the OR between two conditions indexed by \\(y|x=1\\) and \\(y|x=0\\), returns: \\[\\begin{align} OR(y|x=1,y|x=0) = \\frac{P(y=1|x=1)/P(y=0|x=1)}{P(y=1|x=0)/P(y=0|x=0)} = e^{\\beta_1}. \\end{align}\\] The last equality demystifies the choice of the link function in the logistic regression: it allows us to interpret \\(\\beta\\) of the logistic regression as a measure of change of binary random variables, namely, as the (log) odds-ratios due to a unit increase in \\(x\\). Remark. Another popular link function is the normal quantile function, a.k.a., the Gaussian inverse CDF, leading to probit regression instead of logistic regression. 6.2.1 Logistic Regression with R Let’s get us some data. The PlantGrowth data records the weight of plants under three conditions: control, treatment1, and treatment2. head(PlantGrowth) ## weight group ## 1 4.17 ctrl ## 2 5.58 ctrl ## 3 5.18 ctrl ## 4 6.11 ctrl ## 5 4.50 ctrl ## 6 4.61 ctrl We will now attach the data so that its contents is available in the workspace (don’t forget to detach afterwards, or you can expect some conflicting object names). We will also use the cut function to create a binary response variable for Light, and Heavy plants (we are doing logistic regression, so we need a two-class response). As a general rule of thumb, when we discretize continuous variables, we lose information. For pedagogical reasons, however, we will proceed with this bad practice. Look at the following output and think: how many group effects do we expect? What should be the sign of each effect? attach(PlantGrowth) weight.factor&lt;- cut(weight, 2, labels=c(&#39;Light&#39;, &#39;Heavy&#39;)) # binarize weights plot(table(group, weight.factor)) Let’s fit a logistic regression, and inspect the output. glm.1&lt;- glm(weight.factor~group, family=binomial) summary(glm.1) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = weight.factor ~ group, family = binomial) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.1460 -0.6681 0.4590 0.8728 1.7941 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The family argument of glm tells R the respose variable is brenoulli, thus, performing a logistic regression. The summary function is content aware. It gives a different output for glm class objects than for other objects, such as the lm we saw in Chapter 5. In fact, what summary does is merely call summary.glm. As usual, we get the coefficients table, but recall that they are to be interpreted as (log) odd-ratios, i.e., in “link scale”. To return to probabilities (“response scale”), we will need to undo the logistic transformation. As usual, we get the significance for the test of no-effect, versus a two-sided alternative. P-values are asymptotic, thus, only approximate (and can be very bad approximations in small samples). The residuals of glm are slightly different than the lm residuals, and called Deviance Residuals. For help see ?glm, ?family, and ?summary.glm. Like in the linear models, we can use an ANOVA table to check if treatments have any effect, and not one treatment at a time. In the case of GLMs, this is called an analysis of deviance table. anova(glm.1, test=&#39;LRT&#39;) ## Analysis of Deviance Table ## ## Model: binomial, link: logit ## ## Response: weight.factor ## ## Terms added sequentially (first to last) ## ## ## Df Deviance Resid.

All that anova does is call anova.glm. In GLMs there is no canonical test (like the F test for lm). LRT implies we want an approximate Likelihood Ratio Test. We thus specify the type of test desired with the test argument. The distribution of the weights of the plants does vary with the treatment given, as we may see from the significance of the group factor. Readers familiar with ANOVA tables, should know that we computed the GLM equivalent of a type I sum- of-squares. Run drop1(glm.1, test='Chisq') for a GLM equivalent of a type III sum-of-squares. For help see ?anova.glm. Let’s predict the probability of a heavy plant for each treatment. predict(glm.1, type=&#39;response&#39;) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 ## 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 ## 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 ## 0.2 0.2 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 Things to note: Like the summary and anova functions, the predict function is aware that its input is of glm class. All that predict does is call predict.glm. In GLMs there are many types of predictions. The type argument controls which type is returned. Use type=response for predictions in probability scale; use `type=link’ for predictions in log-odds scale. How do I know we are predicting the probability of a heavy plant, and not a light plant? Just run contrasts(weight.factor) to see which of the categories of the factor weight.factor is encoded as 1, and which as 0. For help see ?predict.glm. Let’s detach the data so it is no longer in our workspace, and object names do not collide. detach(PlantGrowth) We gave an example with a factorial (i.e. discrete) predictor. We can do the same with multiple continuous predictors. data(&#39;Pima.te&#39;, package=&#39;MASS&#39;) # Loads data head(Pima.te) ## npreg glu bp skin bmi ped age type ## 1 6 148 72 35 33.6 0.627 50 Yes ## 2 1 85 66 29 26.6 0.351 31 No ## 3 1 89 66 23 28.1 0.167 21 No ## 4 3 78 50 32 31.0 0.248 26 Yes ## 5 2 197 70 45 30.5 0.158 53 Yes ## 6 5 166 72 19 25.8 0.587 51 Yes glm.2&lt;- step(glm(type~., data=Pima.te, family=binomial)) ## Start: AIC=301.79 ## type ~ npreg + glu + bp + skin + bmi + ped + age ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## - skin 1 286.22 300.22 ## - bp 1 286.26 300.26 ## - age 1 286.76 300.76 ## &lt;none&gt; 285.79 301.79 ## - npreg 1 291.60 305.60 ## - ped 1 292.15 306.15 ## - bmi 1 293.83 307.83 ## - glu 1 343.68 357.68 ## ## Step: AIC=300.22 ## type ~ npreg + glu + bp + bmi + ped + age ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## - bp 1 286.73 298.73 ## - age 1 287.23 299.23 ## &lt;none&gt; 286.22 300.22 ## - npreg 1 292.35 304.35 ## - ped 1 292.70 304.70 ## - bmi 1 302.55 314.55 ## - glu 1 344.60 356.60 ## ## Step: AIC=298.73 ## type ~ npreg + glu + bmi + ped + age ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## - age 1 287.44 297.44 ## &lt;none&gt; 286.73 298.73 ## - npreg 1 293.00 303.00 ## - ped 1 293.35 303.35 ## - bmi 1 303.27 313.27 ## - glu 1 344.67 354.67 ## ## Step: AIC=297.44 ## type ~ npreg + glu + bmi + ped ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## &lt;none&gt; 287.44 297.44 ## - ped 1 294.54 302.54 ## - bmi 1 303.72 311.72 ## - npreg 1 304.01 312.01 ## - glu 1 349.80 357.80 summary(glm.2) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = type ~ npreg + glu + bmi + ped, family = binomial, ## data = Pima.te) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.9845 -0.6462 -0.3661 0.5977 2.5304 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Since we want to focus on significant predictors, we used the step function to perform a step-wise regression, i.e. sequentially remove non-significant predictors. The function reports each model it has checked, and the variable it has decided to remove at each step. The output of step is a single model, with the subset of selected predictors. 6.3 Poisson Regression Poisson regression means we fit a model assuming \\(y|x \\sim Poisson(\\lambda(x))\\). Put differently, we assume that for each treatment, encoded as a combinations of predictors \\(x\\), the response is Poisson distributed with a rate that depends on the predictors. The typical link function for Poisson regression is the logarithm: \\(g(t)=log(t)\\). This means that we assume \\(y|x \\sim Poisson(\\lambda(x) = e^{x&#39;\\beta})\\). Why is this a good choice? We again resort to the two-group case, encoded by \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=0\\), to understand this model: \\(\\lambda(x=1)=e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1}=e^{\\beta_0} \\; e^{\\beta_1}= \\lambda(x=0) \\; e^{\\beta_1}\\). We thus see that this link function implies that a change in \\(x\\) multiples the rate of events by \\(e^{\\beta_1}\\). For our example14 we inspect the number of infected high-school kids, as a function of the days since an outbreak. cases &lt;- structure(list(Days = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 6L, 7L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 8L, 12L, 14L, 15L, 17L, 17L, 17L, 18L, 19L, 19L, 20L, 23L, 23L, 23L, 24L, 24L, 25L, 26L, 27L, 28L, 29L, 34L, 36L, 36L, 42L, 42L, 43L, 43L, 44L, 44L, 44L, 44L, 45L, 46L, 48L, 48L, 49L, 49L, 53L, 53L, 53L, 54L, 55L, 56L, 56L, 58L, 60L, 63L, 65L, 67L, 67L, 68L, 71L, 71L, 72L, 72L, 72L, 73L, 74L, 74L, 74L, 75L, 75L, 80L, 81L, 81L, 81L, 81L, 88L, 88L, 90L, 93L, 93L, 94L, 95L, 95L, 95L, 96L, 96L, 97L, 98L, 100L, 101L, 102L, 103L, 104L, 105L, 106L, 107L, 108L, 109L, 110L, 111L, 112L, 113L, 114L, 115L), Students = c(6L, 8L, 12L, 9L, 3L, 3L, 11L, 5L, 7L, 3L, 8L, 4L, 6L, 8L, 3L, 6L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 6L, 3L, 7L, 7L, 2L, 2L, 8L, 3L, 6L, 5L, 7L, 6L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 3L, 5L, 6L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 4L, 4L, 3L, 5L, 4L, 3L, 5L, 3L, 4L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 1L, 3L, 2L, 5L, 4L, 3L, 0L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 0L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 0L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 0L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 1L, 1L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L, 0L)), .Names = c(&quot;Days&quot;, &quot;Students&quot; ), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;, row.names = c(NA, -109L)) attach(cases) head(cases) ## Days Students ## 1 1 6 ## 2 2 8 ## 3 3 12 ## 4 3 9 ## 5 4 3 ## 6 4 3 Look at the following plot and think: Can we assume that the errors have constant variace?

Each day decreases the rate of events by a factor of about \\(e^{\\beta_1}=\\) 0.02. For more information see ?glm and ?family. 6.4 Extensions As we already implied, GLMs are a very wide class of models. We do not need to use the default link function,but more importantly, we are not constrained to Binomial, or Poisson distributed response. For exponential, gamma, and other response distributions, see ?glm or the references in the Bibliographic Notes section. 6.5 Bibliographic Notes The ultimate reference on GLMs is McCullagh (1984). For a less technical exposition, we refer to the usual Venables and Ripley (2013). 6.6 Practice Yourself Try using lm for analyzing the plant growth data in weight.factor as a function of group in the PlantGrowth data. Generate some synthetic data for a logistic regression: Generate two predictor variables of length \\(100\\). They can be random from your favorite distribution. Fix beta&lt;- c(-1,2), and generate the response with:rbinom(n=100,size=1,prob=exp(x %*% beta)/(1+exp(x %*% beta))). Think: why is this the model implied by the logistic regression? Fit a Logistic regression to your synthetic data using glm. Are the estimated coefficients similar to the true ones you used? What is the estimated probability of an event at x=1,1? Use predict.glm but make sure to read the documentation on the type argument. Read about the epil dataset using ? MASS::epil. Inspect the dependency of the number of seizures (\\(y\\)) in the age of the patient (age) and the treatment (trt). Fit a Poisson regression with glm and family = &quot;poisson&quot;. Are the coefficients significant? Does the treatment reduce the frequency of the seizures? According to this model, what would be the number of seizures for 20 years old patient with progabide treatment? References "],

Supposdly, more observations imply more infotmation on the mean. This, however, is not the case if samples are completely dependant. More observations do not add any new information. From this example one may think that dependence is a bad thing. This is a false intuitiont: negative correlations imply oscilations about the mean, so they are actually more informative on the mean than independent observations. Example 7.2 (Repeated Measures) Consider a prospective study, i.e., data that originates from selecting a set of subjects and making measurements on them over time. Also assume that some subjects received some treatment, and other did not. When we want to infer on the population from which these subjects have been sampled, we need to recall that some series of observations came from the same subject. If we were to ignore the subject of origin, and treat each observation as an independent sample point, we will think we have more information in our data than we actually do. For a rough intuition, think of a case where observatiosn within subject are perfectly dependent. The sources of variability, i.e. noise, are known in the statistical literature as “random effects”. Specifying these sources determines the correlation structure in our measurements. In the simplest linear models of Chapter 5, we thought of the variability as a measurement error, independent of anything else. This, however, is rarely the case when time or space are involved. The variability in our data is rarely the object of interest. It is merely the source of uncertainty in our measurements. The effects we want to infer on are assumingly non-random, thus known as “fixed-effects”. A model which has several sources of variability, i.e. random-effects, and several deterministic effects to study, i.e. fixed-effects, is known as a “mixed effects” model. Here are some examples of such models. Example 7.3 (Fixed and Random Machine Effect) Consider the problem of testing for a change in the distribution of diamteters of manufactured bottle caps. We want to study the (fixed) effect of time: before versus after. Bottle caps are produced by several machines. Clearly there is variablity in the diameters within-machine and between-machines. Given many measurements on many bottle caps from many machines, we could standardize measurements by removing each machine’s average. This implies the within-machine variability is the only source of variability we care about, because the substration of the machine effect, removed information on the between-machine variability. Alternatively, we could treat the between-machine variability as another source of noise/uncertainty when inferring on the temporal fixed effect. Example 7.4 (Fixed and Random Subject Effect) Consider an experimenal design where each subject is given 2 types of diets, and his health condition is recorded. We could standardize over subjects by removing the subject-wise average, before comparing diets. This is what a paired t-test does. This also implies the within-subject variability is the only source of variability we care about. Alternatively, for inference on the population of “all subjects” we need to adress the between-subject variability, and not only the within-subject variability. The unifying theme of the above examples, is that the variability in our data has several sources. Which are the sources of variability that need to concern us? This is a delicate matter which depends on your goals. As a rule of thumb, we will suggest the following view: If information of an effect will be available at the time of prediction, treat it as a fixed effect. If it is not, treat it as a random-effect. Mixed models are so fundamental, that they have earned many names: Mixed Effects: Because we may have both fixed effects we want to estimate and remove, and random effects which contribute to the variability to infer against. Variance Components: Because as the examples show, variance has more than a single source (like in the Linear Models of Chapter 5). Hirarchial Models: Because as Example 7.4 demonstrates, we can think of the sampling as hierarchical– first sample a subject, and then sample its response. Multilevel Analysis: For the same reasons it is also known as Hierarchical Models. Repeated Measures: Because we make several measurements from each unit, like in Example 7.4. Longitudinal Data: Because we follow units over time, like in Example 7.4. Panel Data: Is the term typically used in econometric for such longitudinal data. MANOVA: Many of the problems that may be solved with a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), may be solved with a mixed model for reasons we detail in 8. Structured Prediction: In the machine learning literature, predicting outcomes with structure, such as correlated vectors, is known as Structured Learning. Because mixed-models merely specify correlations, using a mixed-model for making predictions may be thought of as an instance of structured prediction. Whether we are aiming to infer on a generative model’s parameters, or to make predictions, there is no “right” nor “wrong” approach. Instead, there is always some implied measure of error, and an algorithm may be good, or bad, with respect to this measure (think of false and true positives, for instance). This is why we care about dependencies in the data: ignoring the dependence structure will probably yield inefficient algorithms. Put differently, if we ignore the statistical dependence in the data we will probably me making more errors than possible/optimal. We now emphasize: Like in previous chapters, by “model” we refer to the assumed generative distribution, i.e., the sampling distribution. Mixed effect models are a way to infer against the right level of variability. Using a naive linear model (which assumes a single source of variability) instead of a mixed effects model, probably means your inference is overly anti-conservative. Put differently, the uncertainty in your estimates is higher than the linear model from Chapter 5 may suggest. In a mixed effect model we will specify the dependence structure via the hierarchy in the sampling scheme (e.g. caps within machine, students within class, etc.). Not all dependency models can be specified in this way. Dependency structures that are not hierarchical include temporal dependencies (AR, ARIMA, ARCH and GARCH), spatial, Markov Chains, and more. To specify dependency structures that are no hierarchical, see Chapter 8 in (the excellent) Weiss (2005). If you are using the model merely for predictions, and not for inference on the fixed effects or variance components, then stating the generative distribution may be be useful, but not necessarily. See the Supervised Learning Chapter 9 for more on prediction problems. Also recall that machine learning from non-independent observations (such as mixed models) is a delicate matter that is rarely treated in the literature. 7.1 Problem Setup \\[\\begin{align} y|x,u = x&#39;\\beta + z&#39;u + \\varepsilon \\tag{7.1} \\end{align}\\] where \\(x\\) are the factors with fixed effects, \\(\\beta\\), which we may want to study. The factors \\(z\\), with effects \\(u\\), are the random effects which contribute to variability. In our repeated measures example (7.2) the treatment is a fixed effect, and the subject is a random effect. In our bottle-caps example (7.3) the time (before vs. after) is a fixed effect, and the machines may be either a fixed or a random effect (depending on the purpose of inference). In our diet example (7.4) the diet is the fixed effect and the family is a random effect. Notice that we state \\(y|x,z\\) merely as a convenient way to do inference on \\(y|x\\), instead of directly specifying \\(Var[y|x]\\). This is exactly the power of mixed-effect models: we specify the covariance not via the matrix \\(Var[y,z]\\), but rather via the sampling hierarchy. Given a sample of \\(n\\) observations \\((y_i,x_i,z_i)\\) from model (7.1), we will want to estimate \\((\\beta,u)\\). Under some assumption on the distribution of \\(\\varepsilon\\) and \\(z\\), we can use maximum likelihood (ML). In the context of mixed-models, however, ML is typically replaced with restricted maximum likelihood (ReML), because it returns unbiased estimates of \\(Var[y|x]\\) and ML does not. 7.1.1 Non-Linear Mixed Models The idea of random-effects can also be implemented for non-linear mean models. Formally, this means that \\(y|x,z=f(x,z,\\varepsilon)\\) for some non-linear \\(f\\). This is known as non-linead-mixed-models, which will not be discussed in this text. 7.1.2 Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) You can marry the ideas of random effects, with non-linear link functions, and non-Gaussian distribution of the response. These are known as Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Wikidot has a nice comparison of several software suits for GLMMs. 7.2 Mixed Models with R We will fit mixed models with the lmer function from the lme4 package, written by the mixed-models Guru Douglas Bates. We start with a small simulation demonstrating the importance of acknowledging your sources of variability. Our demonstration consists of fitting a linear model that assumes independence, when data is clearly dependent. # Simulation parameters n.groups &lt;- 4 # number of groups n.repeats &lt;- 2 # sample per group groups &lt;- rep(1:n.groups, each=n.repeats) %&gt;% as.factor n &lt;- length(groups) z0 &lt;- rnorm(n.groups,0,10) # generate group effects (z &lt;- z0[as.numeric(groups)]) # generate and inspect random group effects ## [1] 6.960992 6.960992 2.380404 2.380404 -8.095683 -8.095683 -3.569163 ## [8] -3.569163 epsilon &lt;- rnorm(n,0,1) # generate measurement error # Generate data beta0 &lt;- 2 # set global mean y &lt;- beta0 + z + epsilon # generate synthetic sample We can now fit the linear and mixed models. lm.5 &lt;- lm(y~z) # fit a linear model assuming independence library(lme4) lme.5 &lt;- lmer(y~1|groups) # fit a mixed-model that deals with the group dependence The summary of the linear model summary.lm.5 &lt;- summary(lm.5) summary.lm.5 ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ z) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.2717 -0.4342 0.2110 0.4527 1.1885 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Because lm treats the group effect15 as a fixed while the mixed model treats the group effect as a source of noise/uncertainty. Clearly, inference using lm underestimates our uncertainty in the estimated population mean (\\(\\beta_0\\)). Now let’s adopt the paired t-test view, which removes the group mean, so that it implicitly ignores the between-group variability. Which is the model compatible with this view? diffs &lt;- tapply(y, groups, diff) diffs # Q:what is this estimating?

Q:Is this a good think? A: depends… 7.2.1 A Single Random Effect We will use the Dyestuff data from the lme4 package, which encodes the yield, in grams, of a coloring solution (dyestuff), produced in 6 batches using 5 different preparations. data(Dyestuff, package=&#39;lme4&#39;) attach(Dyestuff) head(Dyestuff) ## Batch Yield ## 1 A 1545 ## 2 A 1440 ## 3 A 1440 ## 4 A 1520 ## 5 A 1580 ## 6 B 1540 And visually lattice::dotplot(Yield~Batch) If we want to do inference on the (global) mean yield, we need to account for the two sources of variability: the within-batch variability, and the between-batch variability We thus fit a mixed model, with an intercept and random batch effect. lme.1&lt;- lmer( Yield ~ 1 | Batch , Dyestuff ) summary(lme.1) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: Yield ~ 1 | Batch ## Data: Dyestuff ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 319.7 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.4117 -0.7634 0.1418 0.7792 1.8296 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## Batch (Intercept) 1764 42.00 ## Residual 2451 49.51 ## Number of obs: 30, groups: Batch, 6 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std. Error t value ## (Intercept) 1527.50 19.38 78.8 Things to note: The syntax Yield ~ 1 | Batch tells R to fit a model with a global intercept (1) and a random Batch effect (|Batch). More on that later. As usual, summary is content aware and has a different behavior for lme class objects. The output distinguishes between random effects (\\(u\\)), a source of variability, and fixed effect (\\(\\beta\\)), which we want to study. The mean of the random effect is not reported because it is unassumingly 0. Were we not interested in the variance components, and only in the coefficients or predictions, an (almost) equivalent lm formulation is lm(Yield ~ Batch). Some utility functions let us query the lme object. The function coef will work, but will return a cumbersome output. Better use fixef to extract the fixed effects, and ranef to extract the random effects. The model matrix (of the fixed effects alone), can be extracted with model.matrix, and predictions made with predict. Note, however, that predictions with mixed-effect models are better treated as prediction problems as in the Supervised Learning Chapter 9, but are a very delicate matter. detach(Dyestuff) 7.2.2 Multiple Random Effects Let’s make things more interesting by allowing more than one random effect. One-way ANOVA can be thought of as the fixed-effects counterpart of the single random effect. In the Penicillin data, we measured the diameter of spread of an organism, along the plate used (a to x), and penicillin type (A to F). We will now try to infer on the diameter of typical organism, and compute its variability over plates and Penicillin types. head(Penicillin) ## diameter plate sample ## 1 27 a A ## 2 23 a B ## 3 26 a C ## 4 23 a D ## 5 23 a E ## 6 21 a F One sample per combination: attach(Penicillin) table(sample, plate) # how many observations per plate &amp; type? ## plate ## sample a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x ## A 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## B 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## C 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## D 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## E 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## F 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 And visually: Let’s fit a mixed-effects model with a random plate effect, and a random sample effect: lme.2 &lt;- lmer ( diameter ~ 1 + (1|plate )+(1|sample) , Penicillin ) fixef(lme.2) # Fixed effects ## (Intercept) ## 22.97222 ranef(lme.2) # Random effects ## $plate ## (Intercept) ## a 0.80454704 ## b 0.80454704 ## c 0.18167191 ## d 0.33739069 ## e 0.02595313 ## f -0.44120322 ## g -1.37551591 ## h 0.80454704 ## i -0.75264078 ## j -0.75264078 ## k 0.96026582 ## l 0.49310948 ## m 1.42742217 ## n 0.49310948 ## o 0.96026582 ## p 0.02595313 ## q -0.28548443 ## r -0.28548443 ## s -1.37551591 ## t 0.96026582 ## u -0.90835956 ## v -0.28548443 ## w -0.59692200 ## x -1.21979713 ## ## $sample ## (Intercept) ## A 2.18705797 ## B -1.01047615 ## C 1.93789946 ## D -0.09689497 ## E -0.01384214 ## F -3.00374417 Things to note: The syntax 1+ (1| plate ) + (1| sample ) fits a global intercept (mean), a random plate effect, and a random sample effect. Were we not interested in the variance components, an (almost) equivalent lm formulation is lm(diameter ~ plate + sample). The output of ranef is somewhat controversial. Think about it: Why would we want to plot the estimates of a random variable? Since we have two random effects, we may compute the variability of the global mean (the only fixed effect) as we did before. Perhaps more interestingly, we can compute the variability in the response, for a particular plate or sample type. random.effect.lme2 &lt;- ranef(lme.2, condVar = TRUE) qrr2 &lt;- lattice::dotplot(random.effect.lme2, strip = FALSE) Variability in response for each plate, over various sample types: print(qrr2[[1]]) Variability in response for each sample type, over the various plates: print(qrr2[[2]]) Things to note: The condVar argument of the ranef function tells R to compute the variability in response conditional on each random effect at a time. The dotplot function, from the lattice package, is only there for the fancy plotting. We used the penicillin exampe to demonstrate the incoporation of two random-effects. We could have, however, compared between penicillin types. For this matter, penicillin types are fixed effects to infer on, and not part of the uncertainty in the mean diameter. The appropriate model is the following: lme.2.2 &lt;- lmer( diameter ~ 1 + sample + (1|plate) , Penicillin ) I may now ask myself: does the sample, i.e. penicillin, have any effect? This is what the ANOVA table typically gives us. The next table can be thought of as a “repeated measures ANOVA”: anova(lme.2.2) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value ## sample 5 449.22 89.844 297.09 Uhh! No p-values. Why is this? Because Doug Bates, the author of lme4 makes a strong argument against current methods of computing p-values in mixed models. If you insist on an p-value, you may recur to other packages that provide that, at your own caution: car::Anova(lme.2.2) ## Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II Wald chisquare tests) ## ## Response: diameter ## Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq) ## sample 1485.4 5 &lt; 2.2e-16 *** ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 … and yes; the penicillin type has a significant effect on the diamter. 7.2.3 A Full Mixed-Model In the sleepstudy data, we recorded the reaction times to a series of tests (Reaction), after various subject (Subject) underwent various amounts of sleep deprivation (Day). We now want to estimate the (fixed) effect of the days of sleep deprivation on response time, while allowing each subject to have his/hers own effect. Put differently, we want to estimate a random slope for the effect of day. The fixed Days effect can be thought of as the average slope over subjects. lme.3 &lt;- lmer ( Reaction ~ Days + ( Days | Subject ) , data= sleepstudy ) Things to note: ~Days specifies the fixed effect. We used the Days|Subect syntax to tell R we want to fit the model ~Days within each subject. Were we fitting the model for purposes of prediction only, an (almost) equivalent lm formulation is lm(Reaction~Days*Subject).

The answer is yes. The assumptions on the distribution of random effect, namely, that they are normally distributed, allows us to pool information from one subject to another. In the words of John Tukey: “we borrow strength over subjects”. Is this a good thing? If the normality assumption is true, it certainly is. If, on the other hand, you have a lot of samples per subject, and you don’t need to “borrow strength” from one subject to another, you can simply fit within-subject linear models without the mixed-models machinery. To demonstrate the “strength borrowing”, here is a comparison of the lme, versus the effects of fitting a linear model to each subject separately. Here is a comparison of the random-day effect from lme versus a subject-wise linear model. They are not the same. detach(Penicillin) 7.3 Serial Correlations TODO: nlme package. 7.4 Relation to MANOVA Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) deals with the estimation of effect on vector valued outcomes. Put differently: in ANOVA the response, \\(y\\), is univariate. In MANOVA, the outcome is multivariate. MANOVA is useful when there are correlations among the entries of \\(y\\). Otherwise- one may simply solve many ANOVA problems, instead of a single MANOVA. Now assume that the outcome of a MANOVA is measurements of an individual at several time periods. The measurements are clearly correlated, so that MANOVA may be useful. But one may also treat the subject as a random effect, with a univariate response. We thus see that this seemingly MANOVA problem can be solved with the mixed models framework. What MANOVA problems cannot be solved with mixed models? There may be cases where the covariance of the multivariate outcome, \\(y\\), is very complicated. If the covariance in \\(y\\) may not be stated using a combination of random and fixed effects, then the covariance has to be stated explicitly in the MANOVA framework. It is also possible to consider mixed-models with multivariate outcomes, i.e., a mixed MANOVA, or hirarchial MANOVA. The R functions we present herein permit this. 7.4.0.1 MANOVA in R [TODO: nlme:::lme()] 7.5 The Variance-Components View TODO 7.6 Bibliographic Notes Most of the examples in this chapter are from the documentation of the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015). For a general and very applied treatment, see Pinero and Bates (2000). As usual, a hands on view can be found in Venables and Ripley (2013), and also in an excellent blog post by Kristoffer Magnusson For a more theoretical view see Weiss (2005) or Searle, Casella, and McCulloch (2009). Sometimes it is unclear if an effect is random or fixed; on the difference between the two types of inference see Rosset and Tibshirani (2018) and references therein. For more on predictions in linear mixed models see Robinson (1991), Rabinowicz and Rosset (2018), and references therein. 7.7 Practice Yourself Computing the variance of the sample mean given dependent correlations. How does it depend on the covariance between observations? When is the sample most informative on the population mean? Return to the Penicillin data set. Instead of fitting an LME model, fit an LM model with lm. I.e., treat all random effects as fixed. Compare the effect estimates. Compare the standard errors. Compare the predictions of the two models. [Very Advanced!] Return to the Penicillin data and use the gls function to fit a generalized linear model, equivalent to the LME model in our text. Read about the “oats” dataset using ? MASS::oats.Inspect the dependency of the yield (Y) in the Varieties (V) and the Nitrogen treatment (N). Fit a linear model, does the effect of the treatment significant? The interaction between the Varieties and Nitrogen is significant? An expert told you that could be a variance between the different blocks (B) which can bias the analysis. fit a LMM for the data. Do you think the blocks should be taken into account as “random effect” or “fixed effect”? References "],

Broadly speaking, we will discuss statistical inference, and leave more “exploratory flavored” matters like clustering, and visualization, to the Unsupervised Learning Chapter 10. We start with an example. Example 8.1 Consider the problem of a patient monitored in the intensive care unit. At every minute the monitor takes \\(p\\) physiological measurements: blood pressure, body temperature, etc. The total number of minutes in our data is \\(n\\), so that in total, we have \\(n \\times p\\) measurements, arranged in a matrix. We also know the typical measurements for this patient when healthy: \\(\\mu_0\\). Formally, let \\(y\\) be single (random) measurement of a \\(p\\)-variate random vector. Denote \\(\\mu:=E[y]\\). Here is the set of problems we will discuss, in order of their statistical difficulty. Signal detection: a.k.a. multivariate hypothesis testing, i.e., testing if \\(\\mu\\) equals \\(\\mu_0\\) and for \\(\\mu_0=0\\) in particular. In our example: “are the current measurement different than a typical one?” Signal counting: Counting the number of elements in \\(\\mu\\) that differ from \\(\\mu_0\\), and for \\(\\mu_0=0\\) in particular. In our example: “how many measurements differ than their typical values?” Signal identification: a.k.a. multiple testing, i.e., testing which of the elements in \\(\\mu\\) differ from \\(\\mu_0\\) and for \\(\\mu_0=0\\) in particular. In the ANOVA literature, this is known as a post-hoc analysis. In our example: “which measurements differ than their typical values?” Signal estimation: Estimating the magnitudes of the departure of \\(\\mu\\) from \\(\\mu_0\\), and for \\(\\mu_0=0\\) in particular. If estimation follows a signal detection or signal identification stage, this is known as a selective estimation problem. In our example: “what is the value of the measurements that differ than their typical values?” Multivariate Regression: a.k.a. MANOVA in statistical literature, and structured learning in the machine learning literature. In our example: “what factors affect the physiological measurements?” Example 8.2 Consider the problem of detecting regions of cognitive function in the brain using fMRI. Each measurement is the activation level at each location in a brain’s region. If the region has a cognitive function, the mean activation differs than \\(\\mu_0=0\\) when the region is evoked. Example 8.3 Consider the problem of detecting cancer encoding regions in the genome. Each measurement is the vector of the genetic configuration of an individual. A cancer encoding region will have a different (multivariate) distribution between sick and healthy. In particular, \\(\\mu\\) of sick will differ from \\(\\mu\\) of healthy. Example 8.4 Consider the problem of the simplest multiple regression. The estimated coefficient, \\(\\hat \\beta\\) are a random vector. Regression theory tells us that its covariance is \\((X&#39;X)^{-1}\\sigma^2\\), and null mean of \\(\\beta\\). We thus see that inference on the vector of regression coefficients, is nothing more than a multivaraite inference problem. Remark. In the above, “signal” is defined in terms of \\(\\mu\\). It is possible that the signal is not in the location, \\(\\mu\\), but rather in the covariance, \\(\\Sigma\\). We do not discuss these problems here, and refer the reader to Nadler (2008). Another possible question is: does a multivariate analysis gives us something we cannot get from a mass-univariate analysis (i.e., a multivariate analysis on each variable separately). In Example 8.1 we could have just performed multiple univariate tests, and sign an alarm when any of the univariate detectors was triggered. The reason we want a multivariate detector, and not multiple univariate detectors is that it is possible that each measurement alone is borderline, but together, the signal accumulates. In our ICU example is may mean that the pulse is borderline, the body temperature is borderline, etc. Analyzed simultaneously, it is clear that the patient is in distress. The next figure16 illustrates the idea that some bi-variate measurements may seem ordinary univariately, while very anomalous when examined bi-variately. Remark. The following figure may also be used to demonstrate the difference between Euclidean Distance and Mahalanobis Distance. 8.1 Signal Detection Signal detection deals with the detection of the departure of \\(\\mu\\) from some \\(\\mu_0\\), and especially, \\(\\mu_0=0\\). This problem can be thought of as the multivariate counterpart of the univariate hypothesis t-test. 8.1.1 Hotelling’s T2 Test The most fundamental approach to signal detection is a mere generalization of the t-test, known as Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) test. Recall the univariate t-statistic of a data vector \\(x\\) of length \\(n\\): \\[\\begin{align} t^2(x):= \\frac{(\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)^2}{Var[\\bar{x}]}= (\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)Var[\\bar{x}]^{-1}(\\bar{x}-\\mu_0), \\tag{8.1} \\end{align}\\] where \\(Var[\\bar{x}]=S^2(x)/n\\), and \\(S^2(x)\\) is the unbiased variance estimator \\(S^2(x):=(n-1)^{-1}\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2\\). Generalizing Eq(8.1) to the multivariate case: \\(\\mu_0\\) is a \\(p\\)-vector, \\(\\bar x\\) is a \\(p\\)-vector, and \\(Var[\\bar x]\\) is a \\(p \\times p\\) matrix of the covariance between the \\(p\\) coordinated of \\(\\bar x\\). When operating with vectors, the squaring becomes a quadratic form, and the division becomes a matrix inverse. We thus have \\[\\begin{align} T^2(x):= (\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)&#39; Var[\\bar{x}]^{-1} (\\bar{x}-\\mu_0), \\tag{8.2} \\end{align}\\] which is the definition of Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) test statistic. We typically denote the covariance between coordinates in \\(x\\) with \\(\\hat \\Sigma(x)\\), so that \\(\\widehat \\Sigma_{k,l}:=\\widehat {Cov}[x_k,x_l]=(n-1)^{-1} \\sum (x_{k,i}-\\bar x_k)(x_{l,i}-\\bar x_l)\\). Using the \\(\\Sigma\\) notation, Eq.(8.2) becomes \\[\\begin{align} T^2(x):= n (\\bar{x}-\\mu_0)&#39; \\hat \\Sigma(x)^{-1} (\\bar{x}-\\mu_0), \\end{align}\\] which is the standard notation of Hotelling’s test statistic. For inference, we need the null distribution of Hotelling’s test statistic. For this we introduce some vocabulary17: Low Dimension: We call a problem low dimensional if \\(n \\gg p\\), i.e. \\(p/n \\approx 0\\). This means there are many observations per estimated parameter. High Dimension: We call a problem high dimensional if \\(p/n \\to c\\), where \\(c\\in (0,1)\\). This means there are more observations than parameters, but not many. Very High Dimension: We call a problem very high dimensional if \\(p/n \\to c\\), where \\(1&lt;c&lt;\\infty\\). This means there are less observations than parameter. Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) test can only be used in the low dimensional regime. For some intuition on this statement, think of taking \\(n=20\\) measurements of \\(p=100\\) physiological variables. We seemingly have \\(20\\) observations, but there are \\(100\\) unknown quantities in \\(\\mu\\). Would you trust your conclusion that \\(\\bar x\\) is different than \\(\\mu_0\\) based on merely \\(20\\) observations. The above criticism is formalized in Bai and Saranadasa (1996). For modern applications, Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) is not recommended, since many modern alternatives have been made available. See J. Rosenblatt, Gilron, and Mukamel (2016) and references for a review. 8.1.2 Various Types of Signal to Detect In the previous, we assumed that the signal is a departure of \\(\\mu\\) from some \\(\\mu_0\\). For vactor-valued data \\(y\\), that is distributed \\(F\\), we may define “signal” as any departure from some \\(F_0\\). This is the multivaraite counterpart of goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests. Even when restricting “signal” to departures of \\(\\mu\\) from \\(\\mu_0\\), we may try to detect various types of signal: Dense Signal: when the departure is in all coordinates of \\(\\mu\\). Sparse Signal: when the departure is in a subset of coordinates of \\(\\mu\\). A manufactoring motivation is consistent with a dense signal: if a manufacturing process has failed, we expect a change in many measurements (i.e. coordinates of \\(\\mu\\)). A brain-imaging motivation is consistent with a dense signal: if a region encodes cognitive function, we expect a change in many brain locations (i.e. coordinates of \\(\\mu\\).) A genetic motivation is consistent with a sparse signal: if susceptibility of disease is genetic, only a small subset of locations in the genome will encode it. Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) statistic is designed for dense signal. The following is a simple statistic designed for sparse signal. 8.1.3 Simes’ Test Hotelling’s \\(T^2\\) statistic has currently two limitations: It is designed for dense signals, and it requires estimating the covariance, which is a very difficult problem. An algorithm, that is sensitive to sparse signal and allows statistically valid detection under a wide range of covariances (even if we don’t know the covariance) is known as Simes’ Test. The statistic is defined vie the following algorithm: Compute \\(p\\) variable-wise p-values: \\(p_1,\\dots,p_j\\). Denote \\(p_{(1)},\\dots,p_{(j)}\\) the sorted p-values. Simes’ statistic is \\(p_{Simes}:=min_j\\{p_{(j)} \\times p/j\\}\\). Reject the “no signal” null hypothesis at significance \\(\\alpha\\) if \\(p_{Simes}&lt;\\alpha\\). 8.1.4 Signal Detection with R Let’s generate some data with no signal. library(mvtnorm) n &lt;- 100 # observations p &lt;- 18 # parameter dimension mu &lt;- rep(0,p) # no signal x &lt;- rmvnorm(n = n, mean = mu) dim(x) ## [1] 100 18 lattice::levelplot(x) Now make our own Hotelling function. hotellingOneSample &lt;- function(x, mu0=rep(0,ncol(x))){ n &lt;- nrow(x) p &lt;- ncol(x) stopifnot(n &gt; 5* p) bar.x &lt;- colMeans(x) Sigma &lt;- var(x) Sigma.inv &lt;- solve(Sigma) T2 &lt;- n * (bar.x-mu0) %*% Sigma.inv %*% (bar.x-mu0) p.value &lt;- pchisq(q = T2, df = p, lower.tail = FALSE) return(list(statistic=T2, pvalue=p.value)) } hotellingOneSample(x) ## $statistic ## [,1] ## [1,] 15.44672 ## ## $pvalue ## [,1] ## [1,] 0.6310998 Things to note: stopifnot(n &gt; 5 * p) is a little verification to check that the problem is indeed low dimensional. Otherwise, the \\(\\chi^2\\) approximation cannot be trusted. solve returns a matrix inverse. %*% is the matrix product operator (see also crossprod()). A function may return only a single object, so we wrap the statistic and its p-value in a list object. Just for verification, we compare our home made Hotelling’s test, to the implementation in the rrcov package. The statistic is clearly OK, but our \\(\\chi^2\\) approximation of the distribution leaves room to desire. Personally, I would never trust a Hotelling test if \\(n\\) is not much greater than \\(p\\), in which case I would use a high-dimensional adaptation (see Bibliography). rrcov::T2.test(x) ## ## One-sample Hotelling test ## ## data: x ## T2 = 15.44700, F = 0.71079, df1 = 18, df2 = 82, p-value = 0.7908 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean vector is not equal to (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)&#39; ## ## sample estimates: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## mean x-vector -0.01884811 0.01282525 0.08687747 0.02198068 -0.01323497 ## [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## mean x-vector 0.01540043 0.04753548 0.0217144 -0.1534152 -0.14067 ## [,11] [,12] [,13] [,14] [,15] ## mean x-vector 0.1417923 -0.08881329 0.08418828 -0.06422076 -0.1633374 ## [,16] [,17] [,18] ## mean x-vector -0.04710313 -0.05002829 -0.01033344 Let’s do the same with Simes’: Simes &lt;- function(x){ p.vals &lt;- apply(x, 2, function(z) t.test(z)$p.value) # Compute variable-wise pvalues p &lt;- ncol(x) p.Simes &lt;- p * min(sort(p.vals)/seq_along(p.vals)) # Compute the Simes statistic return(c(pvalue=p.Simes)) } Simes(x) ## pvalue ## 0.7704711 And now we verify that both tests can indeed detect signal when present.

All p-values are very small, so that all statistics can detect the non-null distribution. 8.2 Signal Counting There are many ways to approach the signal counting problem. For the purposes of this book, however, we will not discuss them directly, and solve the signal counting problem as a signal identification problem: if we know where \\(\\mu\\) departs from \\(\\mu_0\\), we only need to count coordinates to solve the signal counting problem. Remark. In the sparsity or multiple-testing literature, what we call “signal counting” is known as “adapting to sparsit”, or “adaptivity”. 8.3 Signal Identification The problem of signal identification is also known as selective testing, or more commonly as multiple testing. In the ANOVA literature, an identification stage will typically follow a detection stage. These are known as the omnibus F test, and post-hoc tests, respectively. In the multiple testing literature there will typically be no preliminary detection stage. It is typically assumed that signal is present, and the only question is “where?” The first question when approaching a multiple testing problem is “what is an error”? Is an error declaring a coordinate in \\(\\mu\\) to be different than \\(\\mu_0\\) when it is actually not? Is an error an overly high proportion of falsely identified coordinates? The former is known as the family wise error rate (FWER), and the latter as the false discovery rate (FDR). Remark. These types of errors have many names in many communities. See the Wikipedia entry on ROC for a table of the (endless) possible error measures. 8.3.1 Signal Identification in R One (of many) ways to do signal identification involves the stats::p.adjust function. The function takes as inputs a \\(p\\)-vector of the variable-wise p-values. Why do we start with variable-wise p-values, and not the full data set? Because we want to make inference variable-wise, so it is natural to start with variable-wise statistics. Because we want to avoid dealing with covariances if possible. Computing variable-wise p-values does not require estimating covariances. So that the identification problem is decoupled from the variable-wise inference problem, and may be applied much more generally than in the setup we presented. We start be generating some high-dimensional multivariate data and computing the coordinate-wise (i.e. hypothesis-wise) p-value. library(mvtnorm) n &lt;- 1e1 p &lt;- 1e2 mu &lt;- rep(0,p) x &lt;- rmvnorm(n = n, mean = mu) dim(x) ## [1] 10 100 lattice::levelplot(x) We now compute the pvalues of each coordinate. We use a coordinate-wise t-test. Why a t-test? Because for the purpose of demonstration we want a simple test. In reality, you may use any test that returns valid p-values. t.pval &lt;- function(y) t.test(y)$p.value p.values &lt;- apply(X = x, MARGIN = 2, FUN = t.pval) plot(p.values, type=&#39;h&#39;) Things to note: t.pval is a function that merely returns the p-value of a t.test. We used the apply function to apply the same function to each column of x. MARGIN=2 tells apply to compute over columns and not rows. The output, p.values, is a vector of 100 p-values. We are now ready to do the identification, i.e., find which coordinate of \\(\\mu\\) is different than \\(\\mu_0=0\\). The workflow for identification has the same structure, regardless of the desired error guarantees: Compute an adjusted p-value. Compare the adjusted p-value to the desired error level. If we want \\(FWER \\leq 0.05\\), meaning that we allow a \\(5\\%\\) probability of making any mistake, we will use the method=&quot;holm&quot; argument of p.adjust. alpha &lt;- 0.05 p.values.holm &lt;- p.adjust(p.values, method = &#39;holm&#39; ) which(p.values.holm &lt; alpha) ## integer(0) If we want \\(FDR \\leq 0.05\\), meaning that we allow the proportion of false discoveries to be no larger than \\(5\\%\\), we use the method=&quot;BH&quot; argument of p.adjust. alpha &lt;- 0.05 p.values.BH &lt;- p.adjust(p.values, method = &#39;BH&#39; ) which(p.values.BH &lt; alpha) ## integer(0) We now inject some strong signal in \\(\\mu\\) just to see that the process works. We will artificially inject signal in the first 10 coordinates. mu[1:10] &lt;- 2 # inject signal in first 10 variables x &lt;- rmvnorm(n = n, mean = mu) # generate data p.values &lt;- apply(X = x, MARGIN = 2, FUN = t.pval) p.values.BH &lt;- p.adjust(p.values, method = &#39;BH&#39; ) which(p.values.BH &lt; alpha) ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 22 66 Indeed- we are now able to detect that the first coordinates carry signal, because their respective coordinate-wise null hypotheses have been rejected. 8.4 Signal Estimation (*) The estimation of the elements of \\(\\mu\\) is a seemingly straightforward task. This is not the case, however, if we estimate only the elements that were selected because they were significant (or any other data-dependent criterion). Clearly, estimating only significant entries will introduce a bias in the estimation. In the statistical literature, this is known as selection bias. Selection bias also occurs when you perform inference on regression coefficients after some model selection, say, with a lasso, or a forward search18. Selective inference is a complicated and active research topic so we will not offer any off-the-shelf solution to the matter. The curious reader is invited to read J. D. Rosenblatt and Benjamini (2014), Javanmard and Montanari (2014), or Will Fithian’s PhD thesis (Fithian 2015) for more on the topic. 8.5 Multivariate Regression (*) Multivaraite regression, a.k.a. MANOVA, similar to structured learning in machine learning, is simply a regression problem where the outcome, \\(y\\), is not scalar values but vector valued. It is not to be confused with multiple regression where the predictor, \\(x\\), is vector valued, but the outcome is scalar. If the linear models generalize the two-sample t-test from two, to multiple populations, then multivariate regression generalizes Hotelling’s test in the same way. When the entries of \\(y\\) are independent, MANOVA collapses to multiple univariate regressions. It is only when entries in \\(y\\) are correlated that we can gain in accuracy and power by harnessing these correlations through the MANOVA framework. 8.5.1 Multivariate Regression with R TODO 8.6 Graphical Models (*) Fitting a multivariate distribution, i.e. learning a graphical model, is a very hard task. To see why, consider the problem of \\(p\\) continuous variables. In the simplest case, where we can assume normality, fitting a distributions means estimating the \\(p\\) parameters in the expectation, \\(\\mu\\), and \\(p(p+1)/2\\) parameters in the covariance, \\(\\Sigma\\). The number of observations required for this task, \\(n\\), may be formidable. A more humble task, is to identify independencies, known as structure learning in the machine learning literature. Under the multivariate normality assumption, this means identifying zero entries in \\(\\Sigma\\), or more precisely, zero entries in \\(\\Sigma^{-1}\\). This task can be approached as a signal identification problem (8.3). The same solutions may be applied to identify non-zero entries in \\(\\Sigma\\), instead of \\(\\mu\\) as discussed until now. If multivariate normality cannot be assumed, then identifying independencies cannot be done via the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) and more elaborate algorithms are required. 8.6.1 Graphical Models in R TODO 8.7 Biblipgraphic Notes For a general introduction to multivariate data analysis see Anderson-Cook (2004). For an R oriented introduction, see Everitt and Hothorn (2011). For more on the difficulties with high dimensional problems, see Bai and Saranadasa (1996). For some cutting edge solutions for testing in high-dimension, see J. Rosenblatt, Gilron, and Mukamel (2016) and references therein. Simes’ test is not very well known. It is introduced in Simes (1986), and proven to control the type I error of detection under a PRDS type of dependence in Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001). For more on multiple testing, and signal identification, see Efron (2012). For more on the choice of your error rate see J. Rosenblatt (2013). For an excellent review on graphical models see Kalisch and Bühlmann (2014). Everything you need on graphical models, Bayesian belief networks, and structure learning in R, is collected in the Task View. 8.8 Practice Yourself Generate multivariate data with: set.seed(3) mean&lt;-rexp(50,6) multi&lt;- rmvnorm(n = 100, mean = mean) Use Hotelling’s test to determine if \\(\\mu\\) equals \\(\\mu_0=0\\). Can you detect the signal? Perform t.test on each variable and extract the p-value. Try to identify visually the variables which depart from \\(\\mu_0\\). Use p.adjust to identify in which variables there are any departures from \\(\\mu_0=0\\). Allow 5% probability of making any false identification. Use p.adjust to identify in which variables there are any departures from \\(\\mu_0=0\\). Allow a 5% proportion of errors within identifications. Generate multivariate data from two groups: rmvnorm(n = 100, mean = rep(0,10)) for the first, and rmvnorm(n = 100, mean = rep(0.1,10)) for the second. Do we agree the groups differ? Implement the two-group Hotelling test described in Wikipedia: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_T-squared_distribution#Two-sample_statistic). Verify that you are able to detect that the groups differ. Perform a two-group t-test on each coordinate. On which coordinates can you detect signal while controlling the FWER? On which while controlling the FDR? Use p.adjust. Return to the previous problem, but set n=9. Verify that you cannot compute your Hotelling statistic. References "],

The name takes from the fact that by giving the machine data samples with known inputs (a.k.a. features) and desired outputs (a.k.a. labels), the human is effectively supervising the learning. If we think of the inputs as predictors, and outcomes as predicted, it is no wonder that supervised learning is very similar to statistical prediction. When asked “are these the same?” I like to give the example of internet fraud. If you take a sample of fraud “attacks”, a statistical formulation of the problem is highly unlikely. This is because fraud events are not randomly drawn from some distribution, but rather, arrive from an adversary learning the defenses and adapting to it. This instance of supervised learning is more similar to game theory than statistics. Other types of machine learning problems include (Sammut and Webb 2011): Unsupervised learning: See Chapter 10. Semi supervised learning: Where only part of the samples are labeled. A.k.a. co-training, learning from labeled and unlabeled data, transductive learning. Active learning: Where the machine is allowed to query the user for labels. Very similar to adaptive design of experiments. Learning on a budget: A version of active learning where querying for labels induces variable costs. Weak learning: A version of supervised learning where the labels are given not by an expert, but rather by some heuristic rule. Example: mass-labeling cyber attacks by a rule based software, instead of a manual inspection. Reinforcement learning: Similar to active learning, in that the machine may query for labels. Different from active learning, in that the machine does not receive labels, but rewards. Structure learning: When predicting objects with structure such as dependent vectors, graphs, images, tensors, etc. Manifold learning: An instance of unsupervised learning, where the goal is to reduce the dimension of the data by embedding it into a lower dimensional manifold. A.k.a. support estimation. Learning to learn: Deals with the carriage of “experience” from one learning problem to another. A.k.a. cummulative learning, knowledge transfer, and meta learning. 9.1 Problem Setup We now present the empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach to supervised learning, a.k.a. M-estimation in the statistical literature. Remark. We do not discuss purely algorithmic approaches such as K-nearest neighbour and kernel smoothing due to space constraints. For a broader review of supervised learning, see the Bibliographic Notes. Example 9.1 (Rental Prices) Consider the problem of predicting if a mail is spam or not based on its attributes: length, number of exclamation marks, number of recipients, etc. Given \\(n\\) samples with inputs \\(x\\) from some space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and desired outcome, \\(y\\), from some space \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\). In our example, \\(y\\) is the spam/no-spam label, and \\(x\\) is a vector of the mail’s attributes. Samples, \\((x,y)\\) have some distribution we denote \\(P\\). We want to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs, i.e., that classifies to spam given. This function is called a hypothesis, or predictor, denoted \\(f\\), that belongs to a hypothesis class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) such that \\(f:\\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathcal{Y}\\). We also choose some other function that fines us for erroneous prediction. This function is called the loss, and we denote it by \\(l:\\mathcal{Y}\\times \\mathcal{Y} \\to \\mathbb{R}^+\\). Remark. The hypothesis in machine learning is only vaguely related the hypothesis in statistical testing, which is quite confusing. Remark. The hypothesis in machine learning is not a bona-fide statistical model since we don’t assume it is the data generating process, but rather some function which we choose for its good predictive performance. The fundamental task in supervised (statistical) learning is to recover a hypothesis that minimizes the average loss in the sample, and not in the population. This is know as the risk minimization problem. Definition 9.1 (Risk Function) The risk function, a.k.a. generalization error, or test error, is the population average loss of a predictor \\(f\\): \\[\\begin{align} R(f):=\\mathbb{E}_P[l(f(x),y)]. \\end{align}\\] The best predictor, is the risk minimizer: \\[\\begin{align} f^* := argmin_f \\{R(f)\\}. \\tag{9.1} \\end{align}\\] Another fundamental problem is that we do not know the distribution of all possible inputs and outputs, \\(P\\). We typically only have a sample of \\((x_i,y_i), i=1,\\dots,n\\). We thus state the empirical counterpart of (9.1), which consists of minimizing the average loss. This is known as the empirical risk miminization problem (ERM). Definition 9.2 (Empirical Risk) The empirical risk function, a.k.a. in-sample error, or train error, is the sample average loss of a predictor \\(f\\): \\[\\begin{align} R_n(f):= 1/n \\sum_i l(f(x_i),y_i). \\end{align}\\] A good candidate proxy for \\(f^*\\) is its empirical counterpart, \\(\\hat f\\), known as the empirical risk minimizer: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat f := argmin_f \\{ R_n(f) \\}. \\tag{9.2} \\end{align}\\] To make things more explicit: \\(f\\) may be a linear function of the attributes, so that it may be indexed simply with its coefficient vector \\(\\beta\\). \\(l\\) may be a squared error loss: \\(l(f(x),y):=(f(x)-y)^2\\). Under these conditions, the best predictor \\(f^* \\in \\mathcal{F}\\) from problem (9.1) is to \\[\\begin{align} f^* := argmin_\\beta \\{ \\mathbb{E}_{P(x,y)}[(x&#39;\\beta-y)^2] \\}. \\end{align}\\] When using a linear hypothesis with squared loss, we see that the empirical risk minimization problem collapses to an ordinary least-squares problem: \\[\\begin{align} \\hat f := argmin_\\beta \\{1/n \\sum_i (x_i&#39;\\beta - y_i)^2 \\}. \\end{align}\\] When data samples are assumingly independent, then maximum likelihood estimation is also an instance of ERM, when using the (negative) log likelihood as the loss function. If we don’t assume any structure on the hypothesis, \\(f\\), then \\(\\hat f\\) from (9.2) will interpolate the data, and \\(\\hat f\\) will be a very bad predictor. We say, it will overfit the observed data, and will have bad performance on new data. We have several ways to avoid overfitting: Restrict the hypothesis class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) (such as linear functions). Penalize for the complexity of \\(f\\). The penalty denoted by \\(\\Vert f \\Vert\\). Unbiased risk estimation: \\(R_n(f)\\) is not an unbiased estimator of \\(R(f)\\). Why? Think of estimating the mean with the sample minimum… Because \\(R_n(f)\\) is downward biased, we may add some correction term, or compute \\(R_n(f)\\) on different data than the one used to recover \\(\\hat f\\). Almost all ERM algorithms consist of some combination of all the three methods above. 9.1.1 Common Hypothesis Classes Some common hypothesis classes, \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), with restricted complexity, are: Linear hypotheses: such as linear models, GLMs, and (linear) support vector machines (SVM). Neural networks: a.k.a. feed-forward neural nets, artificial neural nets, and the celebrated class of deep neural nets. Tree: a.k.a. decision rules, is a class of hypotheses which can be stated as “if-then” rules. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space: a.k.a. RKHS, is a subset of “the space of all functions19” that is both large enough to capture very complicated relations, but small enough so that it is less prone to overfitting, and also surprisingly simple to compute with. 9.1.2 Common Complexity Penalties The most common complexity penalty applies to classes that have a finite dimensional parametric representation, such as the class of linear predictors, parametrized via its coefficients \\(\\beta\\). In such classes we may penalize for the norm of the parameters. Common penalties include: Ridge penalty: penalizing the \\(l_2\\) norm of the parameter. I.e. \\(\\Vert f \\Vert=\\Vert \\beta \\Vert_2^2=\\sum_j \\beta_j^2\\). LASSO penalty: penalizing the \\(l_1\\) norm of the parameter. I.e., \\(\\Vert f \\Vert=\\Vert \\beta \\Vert_1=\\sum_j |\\beta_j|\\) Elastic net: a combination of the lasso and ridge penalty. I.e. ,\\(\\Vert f \\Vert= \\alpha \\Vert \\beta \\Vert_2^2 + (1-\\alpha) \\Vert \\beta \\Vert_1\\). Function Norms: If the hypothesis class \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) does not admit a finite dimensional representation, the penalty is no longer a function of the parameters of the function. We may, however, penalize not the parametric representation of the function, but rather the function itself \\(\\Vert f \\Vert=\\sqrt{\\int f(t)^2 dt}\\). 9.1.3 Unbiased Risk Estimation The fundamental problem of overfitting, is that the empirical risk, \\(R_n(\\hat f)\\), is downward biased to the population risk, \\(R(\\hat f)\\). We can remove this bias in two ways: (a) purely algorithmic resampling approaches, and (b) theory driven estimators. Train-Validate-Test: The simplest form of algorithmic validation is to split the data. A train set to train/estimate/learn \\(\\hat f\\). A validation set to compute the out-of-sample expected loss, \\(R(\\hat f)\\), and pick the best performing predictor. A test sample to compute the out-of-sample performance of the selected hypothesis. This is a very simple approach, but it is very “data inefficient”, thus motivating the next method. V-Fold Cross Validation: By far the most popular algorithmic unbiased risk estimator; in V-fold CV we “fold” the data into \\(V\\) non-overlapping sets. For each of the \\(V\\) sets, we learn \\(\\hat f\\) with the non-selected fold, and assess \\(R(\\hat f)\\)) on the selected fold. We then aggregate results over the \\(V\\) folds, typically by averaging. AIC: Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) is a theory driven correction of the empirical risk, so that it is unbiased to the true risk. It is appropriate when using the likelihood loss. Cp: Mallow’s Cp is an instance of AIC for likelihood loss under normal noise. Other theory driven unbiased risk estimators include the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC, aka SBC, aka SBIC), the Minimum Description Length (MDL), Vapnic’s Structural Risk Minimization (SRM), the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), and the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQC). Other resampling based unbiased risk estimators include resampling without replacement algorithms like delete-d cross validation with its many variations, and resampling with replacement, like the bootstrap, with its many variations. 9.1.4 Collecting the Pieces An ERM problem with regularization will look like \\[\\begin{align} \\hat f := argmin_{f \\in \\mathcal{F}} \\{ R_n(f) + \\lambda \\Vert f \\Vert \\}. \\tag{9.3} \\end{align}\\] Collecting ideas from the above sections, a typical supervised learning pipeline will include: choosing the hypothesis class, choosing the penalty function and level, unbiased risk estimator. We emphasize that choosing the penalty function, \\(\\Vert f \\Vert\\) is not enough, and we need to choose how “hard” to apply it. This if known as the regularization level, denoted by \\(\\lambda\\) in Eq.(9.3). Examples of such combos include: Linear regression, no penalty, train-validate test. Linear regression, no penalty, AIC. Linear regression, \\(l_2\\) penalty, V-fold CV. This combo is typically known as ridge regression. Linear regression, \\(l_1\\) penalty, V-fold CV. This combo is typically known as LASSO regression. Linear regression, \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) penalty, V-fold CV. This combo is typically known as elastic net regression. Logistic regression, \\(l_2\\) penalty, V-fold CV. SVM classification, \\(l_2\\) penalty, V-fold CV. Deep network, no penalty, V-fold CV. Unrestricted, \\(\\Vert \\partial^2 f \\Vert_2\\), V-fold CV. This combo is typically known as a smoothing spline. For fans of statistical hypothesis testing we will also emphasize: Testing and prediction are related, but are not the same: In the current chapter, we do not claim our models, \\(f\\), are generative. I.e., we do not claim that there is some causal relation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). We only claim that \\(x\\) predicts \\(y\\). It is possible that we will want to ignore a significant predictor, and add a non-significant one (Foster and Stine 2004). Some authors will use hypothesis testing as an initial screening for candidate predictors. This is a useful heuristic, but that is all it is– a heuristic. It may also fail miserably if predictors are linearly dependent (a.k.a. multicollinear). 9.2 Supervised Learning in R At this point, we have a rich enough language to do supervised learning with R. In these examples, I will use two data sets from the ElemStatLearn package, that accompanies the seminal book by Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2001). I use the spam data for categorical predictions, and prostate for continuous predictions. In spam we will try to decide if a mail is spam or not. In prostate we will try to predict the size of a cancerous tumor. You can now call ?prostate and ?spam to learn more about these data sets. Some boring pre-processing. library(ElemStatLearn) data(&quot;prostate&quot;) data(&quot;spam&quot;) library(magrittr) # for piping # Preparing prostate data prostate &lt;- as.data.table(prostate) prostate.train &lt;- prostate[train==TRUE, -&quot;train&quot;] prostate.test &lt;- prostate[train!=TRUE, -&quot;train&quot;] y.train &lt;- prostate.train$lcavol X.train &lt;- as.matrix(prostate.train[, -&#39;lcavol&#39;] ) y.test &lt;- prostate.test$lcavol X.test &lt;- as.matrix(prostate.test[, -&#39;lcavol&#39;] ) # Preparing spam data: n &lt;- nrow(spam) train.prop &lt;- 0.66 train.ind &lt;- c(TRUE,FALSE) %&gt;% sample(size = n, prob = c(train.prop,1-train.prop), replace=TRUE) spam.train &lt;- spam[train.ind,] spam.test &lt;- spam[!train.ind,] y.train.spam &lt;- spam.train$spam X.train.spam &lt;- as.matrix(spam.train[,names(spam.train)!=&#39;spam&#39;] ) y.test.spam &lt;- spam.test$spam X.test.spam &lt;- as.matrix(spam.test[,names(spam.test)!=&#39;spam&#39;]) spam.dummy &lt;- spam spam.dummy$spam &lt;- as.numeric(spam$spam==&#39;spam&#39;) spam.train.dummy &lt;- spam.dummy[train.ind,] spam.test.dummy &lt;- spam.dummy[!train.ind,] We also define some utility functions that we will require down the road. l2 &lt;- function(x) x^2 %&gt;% sum %&gt;% sqrt l1 &lt;- function(x) abs(x) %&gt;% sum MSE &lt;- function(x) x^2 %&gt;% mean missclassification &lt;- function(tab) sum(tab[c(2,3)])/sum(tab) 9.2.1 Linear Models with Least Squares Loss The simplest approach to supervised learning, is simply with OLS: a linear predictor, squared error loss, and train-test risk estimator. Notice the better in-sample MSE than the out-of-sample. That is overfitting in action. ols.1 &lt;- lm(lcavol~. ,data = prostate.train) # Train error: MSE( predict(ols.1)-prostate.train$lcavol) ## [1] 0.4383709 # Test error: MSE( predict(ols.1, newdata=prostate.test)- prostate.test$lcavol) ## [1] 0.5084068 Things to note: I use the newdata argument of the predict function to make the out-of-sample predictions required to compute the test-error. The test error is larger than the train error. That is overfitting in action. We now implement a V-fold CV, instead of our train-test approach. The assignment of each observation to each fold is encoded in fold.assignment. The following code is extremely inefficient, but easy to read. folds &lt;- 10 fold.assignment &lt;- sample(1:folds, nrow(prostate), replace = TRUE) errors &lt;- NULL for (k in 1:folds){ prostate.cross.train &lt;- prostate[fold.assignment!=k,] # train subset prostate.cross.test &lt;- prostate[fold.assignment==k,] # test subset .ols &lt;- lm(lcavol~. ,data = prostate.cross.train) # train .predictions &lt;- predict(.ols, newdata=prostate.cross.test) .errors &lt;- .predictions-prostate.cross.test$lcavol # save prediction errors in the fold errors &lt;- c(errors, .errors) # aggregate error over folds. } # Cross validated prediction error: MSE(errors) ## [1] 0.5492978 Let’s try all possible variable subsets, and choose the best performer with respect to the Cp criterion, which is an unbiased risk estimator. This is done with leaps::regsubsets. We see that the best performer has 3 predictors. regfit.full &lt;- prostate.train %&gt;% leaps::regsubsets(lcavol~.,data = ., method = &#39;exhaustive&#39;) # best subset selection plot(regfit.full, scale = &quot;Cp&quot;) Things to note: The plot shows us which is the variable combination which is the best, i.e., has the smallest Cp. Scanning over all variable subsets is impossible when the number of variables is large. Instead of the Cp criterion, we now compute the train and test errors for all the possible predictor subsets20. In the resulting plot we can see overfitting in action. model.n &lt;- regfit.full %&gt;% summary %&gt;% length X.train.named &lt;- model.matrix(lcavol ~ ., data = prostate.train ) X.test.named &lt;- model.matrix(lcavol ~ ., data = prostate.test ) val.errors &lt;- rep(NA, model.n) train.errors &lt;- rep(NA, model.n) for (i in 1:model.n) { coefi &lt;- coef(regfit.full, id = i) # exctract coefficients of i&#39;th model pred &lt;- X.train.named[, names(coefi)] %*% coefi # make in-sample predictions train.errors[i] &lt;- MSE(y.train - pred) # train errors pred &lt;- X.test.named[, names(coefi)] %*% coefi # make out-of-sample predictions val.errors[i] &lt;- MSE(y.test - pred) # test errors } Plotting results. plot(train.errors, ylab = &quot;MSE&quot;, pch = 19, type = &quot;o&quot;) points(val.errors, pch = 19, type = &quot;b&quot;, col=&quot;blue&quot;) legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Training&quot;, &quot;Validation&quot;), col = c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), pch = 19) Checking all possible models is computationally very hard. Forward selection is a greedy approach that adds one variable at a time. ols.0 &lt;- lm(lcavol~1 ,data = prostate.train) model.scope &lt;- list(upper=ols.1, lower=ols.0) step(ols.0, scope=model.scope, direction=&#39;forward&#39;, trace = TRUE) ## Start: AIC=30.1 ## lcavol ~ 1 ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + lpsa 1 54.776 47.130 -19.570 ## + lcp 1 48.805 53.101 -11.578 ## + svi 1 35.829 66.077 3.071 ## + pgg45 1 23.789 78.117 14.285 ## + gleason 1 18.529 83.377 18.651 ## + lweight 1 9.186 92.720 25.768 ## + age 1 8.354 93.552 26.366 ## &lt;none&gt; 101.906 30.097 ## + lbph 1 0.407 101.499 31.829 ## ## Step: AIC=-19.57 ## lcavol ~ lpsa ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## + lcp 1 14.8895 32.240 -43.009 ## + svi 1 5.0373 42.093 -25.143 ## + gleason 1 3.5500 43.580 -22.817 ## + pgg45 1 3.0503 44.080 -22.053 ## + lbph 1 1.8389 45.291 -20.236 ## + age 1 1.5329 45.597 -19.785 ## &lt;none&gt; 47.130 -19.570 ## + lweight 1 0.4106 46.719 -18.156 ## ## Step: AIC=-43.01 ## lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp ## ## Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC ## &lt;none&gt; 32.240 -43.009 ## + age 1 0.92315 31.317 -42.955 ## + pgg45 1 0.29594 31.944 -41.627 ## + gleason 1 0.21500 32.025 -41.457 ## + lbph 1 0.13904 32.101 -41.298 ## + lweight 1 0.05504 32.185 -41.123 ## + svi 1 0.02069 32.220 -41.052 ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = lcavol ~ lpsa + lcp, data = prostate.train) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) lpsa lcp ## 0.08798 0.53369 0.38879 Things to note: By default step add variables according to the AIC criterion, which is a theory-driven unbiased risk estimator. We need to tell step which is the smallest and largest models to consider using the scope argument. direction='forward' is used to “grow” from a small model. For “shrinking” a large model, use direction='backward', or the default direction='stepwise'. We now learn a linear predictor on the spam data using, a least squares loss, and train-test risk estimator. # Train the predictor ols.2 &lt;- lm(spam~., data = spam.train.dummy) # make in-sample predictions .predictions.train &lt;- predict(ols.2) &gt; 0.5 # inspect the confusion matrix (confusion.train &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.train, truth=spam.train.dummy$spam)) ## truth ## prediction 0 1 ## FALSE 1762 257 ## TRUE 80 908 # compute the train (in sample) misclassification missclassification(confusion.train) ## [1] 0.1120718 # make out-of-sample prediction .predictions.test &lt;- predict(ols.2, newdata = spam.test.dummy) &gt; 0.5 # inspect the confusion matrix (confusion.test &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.test, truth=spam.test.dummy$spam)) ## truth ## prediction 0 1 ## FALSE 905 146 ## TRUE 41 502 # compute the train (in sample) misclassification missclassification(confusion.test) ## [1] 0.1173149 Things to note: I can use lm for categorical outcomes. lm will simply dummy-code the outcome. A linear predictor trained on 0’s and 1’s will predict numbers. Think of these numbers as the probability of 1, and my prediction is the most probable class: predicts()&gt;0.5. The train error is smaller than the test error. This is overfitting in action. The glmnet package is an excellent package that provides ridge, LASSO, and elastic net regularization, for all GLMs, so for linear models in particular. suppressMessages(library(glmnet)) means &lt;- apply(X.train, 2, mean) sds &lt;- apply(X.train, 2, sd) X.train.scaled &lt;- X.train %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = means, FUN = `-`) %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = sds, FUN = `/`) ridge.2 &lt;- glmnet(x=X.train.scaled, y=y.train, family = &#39;gaussian&#39;, alpha = 0) # Train error: MSE( predict(ridge.2, newx =X.train.scaled)- y.train) ## [1] 1.006028 # Test error: X.test.scaled &lt;- X.test %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = means, FUN = `-`) %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = sds, FUN = `/`) MSE(predict(ridge.2, newx = X.test.scaled)- y.test) ## [1] 0.7678264 Things to note: The alpha=0 parameters tells R to do ridge regression. Setting \\(alpha=1\\) will do LASSO, and any other value, with return an elastic net with appropriate weights. The family='gaussian' argument tells R to fit a linear model, with least squares loss. Features for regularized predictors should be z-scored before learning. We use the sweep function to z-score the predictors: we learn the z-scoring from the train set, and apply it to both the train and the test. The test error is smaller than the train error. This may happen because risk estimators are random. Their variance may mask the overfitting. We now use the LASSO penalty. lasso.1 &lt;- glmnet(x=X.train.scaled, y=y.train, , family=&#39;gaussian&#39;, alpha = 1) # Train error: MSE( predict(lasso.1, newx =X.train.scaled)- y.train) ## [1] 0.5525279 # Test error: MSE( predict(lasso.1, newx = X.test.scaled)- y.test) ## [1] 0.5211263 We now use glmnet for classification. means.spam &lt;- apply(X.train.spam, 2, mean) sds.spam &lt;- apply(X.train.spam, 2, sd) X.train.spam.scaled &lt;- X.train.spam %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = means.spam, FUN = `-`) %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = sds.spam, FUN = `/`) %&gt;% as.matrix logistic.2 &lt;- cv.glmnet(x=X.train.spam.scaled, y=y.train.spam, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, alpha = 0) Things to note: We used cv.glmnet to do an automatic search for the optimal level of regularization (the lambda argument in glmnet) using V-fold CV. Just like the glm function, 'family='binomial' is used for logistic regression. We z-scored features so that they all have the same scale. We set alpha=0 for an \\(l_2\\) penalization of the coefficients of the logistic regression. # Train confusion matrix: .predictions.train &lt;- predict(logistic.2, newx = X.train.spam.scaled, type = &#39;class&#39;) (confusion.train &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.train, truth=spam.train$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 1766 188 ## spam 76 977 # Train misclassification error missclassification(confusion.train) ## [1] 0.08779514 # Test confusion matrix: X.test.spam.scaled &lt;- X.test.spam %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = means.spam, FUN = `-`) %&gt;% sweep(MARGIN = 2, STATS = sds.spam, FUN = `/`) %&gt;% as.matrix .predictions.test &lt;- predict(logistic.2, newx = X.test.spam.scaled, type=&#39;class&#39;) (confusion.test &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.test, truth=y.test.spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 907 110 ## spam 39 538 # Test misclassification error: missclassification(confusion.test) ## [1] 0.09347553 9.2.2 SVM A support vector machine (SVM) is a linear hypothesis class with a particular loss function known as a hinge loss.

Various hypothesis classes may be used by changing the kernel argument. 9.2.3 Neural Nets Neural nets (non deep) can be fitted, for example, with the nnet function in the nnet package. We start with a nnet regression. library(nnet) nnet.1 &lt;- nnet(lcavol~., size=20, data=prostate.train, rang = 0.1, decay = 5e-4, maxit = 1000, trace=FALSE) # Train error: MSE( predict(nnet.1)- prostate.train$lcavol) ## [1] 1.178329 # Test error: MSE( predict(nnet.1, newdata = prostate.test)- prostate.test$lcavol) ## [1] 1.204695 And nnet classification. nnet.2 &lt;- nnet(spam~., size=5, data=spam.train, rang = 0.1, decay = 5e-4, maxit = 1000, trace=FALSE) # Train confusion matrix: .predictions.train &lt;- predict(nnet.2, type=&#39;class&#39;) (confusion.train &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.train, truth=spam.train$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 1801 25 ## spam 41 1140 missclassification(confusion.train) ## [1] 0.02194879 # Test confusion matrix: .predictions.test &lt;- predict(nnet.2, newdata = spam.test, type=&#39;class&#39;) (confusion.test &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.test, truth=spam.test$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 910 54 ## spam 36 594 missclassification(confusion.test) ## [1] 0.05646173 9.2.3.1 Deep Nets TODO 9.2.4 Classification and Regression Trees (CART) A CART, is not a linear hypothesis class. It partitions the feature space \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), thus creating a set of if-then rules for prediction or classification. It is thus particularly useful when you believe that the predicted classes may change abruptly with small changes in \\(x\\). 9.2.4.1 The rpart Package This view clarifies the name of the function rpart, which recursively partitions the feature space. We start with a regression tree. library(rpart) tree.1 &lt;- rpart(lcavol~., data=prostate.train) # Train error: MSE( predict(tree.1)- prostate.train$lcavol) ## [1] 0.4909568 # Test error: MSE( predict(tree.1, newdata = prostate.test)- prostate.test$lcavol) ## [1] 0.5623316 We can use the rpart.plot package to visualize and interpret the predictor. rpart.plot::rpart.plot(tree.1) Trees are very prone to overfitting. To avoid this, we reduce a tree’s complexity by pruning it. This is done with the prune function (not demonstrated herein). We now fit a classification tree. tree.2 &lt;- rpart(spam~., data=spam.train) # Train confusion matrix: .predictions.train &lt;- predict(tree.2, type=&#39;class&#39;) (confusion.train &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.train, truth=spam.train$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 1766 216 ## spam 76 949 missclassification(confusion.train) ## [1] 0.09710675 # Test confusion matrix: .predictions.test &lt;- predict(tree.2, newdata = spam.test, type=&#39;class&#39;) (confusion.test &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.test, truth=spam.test$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 910 121 ## spam 36 527 missclassification(confusion.test) ## [1] 0.09849435 9.2.4.2 The caret Package TODO 9.2.5 K-nearest neighbour (KNN) KNN is not an ERM problem. In the KNN algorithm, a prediction at some \\(x\\) is made based on the \\(y\\) is it neighbours. This means that: KNN is an Instance Based learning algorith where we do not learn the values of some parametric fnuction, but rather, need the original sample to make predictions. This has many implications when dealing with “BigData”. It may only be applied in spaces with known/defined matric. It is thus harder to apply in the presence of missing values, or in “string-spaces”, “genome-spaces”, etc. where no canonical metric exists. KNN is so fundamental that we show how to fit such a hypothesis class, even if it not an ERM algorith. Is KNN any good? I have never seen a learning problem where KNN beats other methods. Others claim differently. library(class) knn.1 &lt;- knn(train = X.train.spam.scaled, test = X.test.spam.scaled, cl =y.train.spam, k = 1) # Test confusion matrix: .predictions.test &lt;- knn.1 (confusion.test &lt;- table(prediction=.predictions.test, truth=spam.test$spam)) ## truth ## prediction email spam ## email 863 76 ## spam 83 572 missclassification(confusion.test) ## [1] 0.09974906 9.2.6 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) LDA is equivalent to least squares classification 9.2.1. This means that we actually did LDA when we used lm for binary classification (feel free to compare the confusion matrices).

This means the machine has access to a set of inputs, \\(x\\), but the desired outcome, \\(y\\) is not available. Clearly, learning a relation between inputs and outcomes makes no sense, but there are still a lot of problems of interest. In particular, we may want to find a compact representation of the inputs, be it for visualization of further processing. This is the problem of dimensionality reduction. For the same reasons we may want to group similar inputs. This is the problem of clustering. In the statistical terminology, with some exceptions, this chapter can be thought of as multivariate exploratory statistics. For multivariate inference, see Chapter 8. 10.1 Dimensionality Reduction Example 10.1 Consider the heights and weights of a sample of individuals. The data may seemingly reside in \\(2\\) dimensions but given the height, we have a pretty good guess of a persons weight, and vice versa. We can thus state that heights and weights are not really two dimensional, but roughly lay on a \\(1\\) dimensional subspace of \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Example 10.2 Consider the correctness of the answers to a questionnaire with \\(p\\) questions. The data may seemingly reside in a \\(p\\) dimensional space, but assuming there is a thing as “skill”, then given the correctness of a person’s reply to a subset of questions, we have a good idea how he scores on the rest. Put differently, we don’t really need a \\(200\\) question questionnaire– \\(100\\) is more than enough. If skill is indeed a one dimensional quality, then the questionnaire data should organize around a single line in the \\(p\\) dimensional cube. Example 10.3 Consider \\(n\\) microphones recording an individual. The digitized recording consists of \\(p\\) samples. Are the recordings really a shapeless cloud of \\(n\\) points in \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\)? Since they all record the same sound, one would expect the \\(n\\) \\(p\\)-dimensional points to arrange around the source sound bit: a single point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\). If microphones have different distances to the source, volumes may differ. We would thus expect the \\(n\\) points to arrange about a line in \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\). 10.1.1 Principal Component Analysis Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is such a basic technique, it has been rediscovered and renamed independently in many fields. It can be found under the names of Discrete Karhunen–Loève Transform; Hotteling Transform; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition; Eckart–Young Theorem; Schmidt–Mirsky Theorem; Empirical Orthogonal Functions; Empirical Eigenfunction Decomposition; Empirical Component Analysis; Quasi-Harmonic Modes; Spectral Decomposition; Empirical Modal Analysis, and possibly more21. The many names are quite interesting as they offer an insight into the different problems that led to PCA’s (re)discovery. Return to the BMI problem in Example 10.1. Assume you wish to give each individual a “size score”, that is a linear combination of height and weight: PCA does just that. It returns the linear combination that has the largest variability, i.e., the combination which best distinguishes between individuals. The variance maximizing motivation above was the one that guided Hotelling (1933). But \\(30\\) years before him, Pearson (1901) derived the same procedure with a different motivation in mind. Pearson was also trying to give each individual a score. He did not care about variance maximization, however. He simply wanted a small set of coordinates in some (linear) space that approximates the original data well. Before we proceed, we give an example to fix ideas. Consider the crime rate data in USArrests, which encodes reported murder events, assaults, rapes, and the urban population of each american state. head(USArrests) ## Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape ## Alabama 13.2 236 58 21.2 ## Alaska 10.0 263 48 44.5 ## Arizona 8.1 294 80 31.0 ## Arkansas 8.8 190 50 19.5 ## California 9.0 276 91 40.6 ## Colorado 7.9 204 78 38.7 Following Hotelling’s motivation, we may want to give each state a “crimilality score”. We first remove the UrbanPop variable, which does not encode crime levels. We then z-score each variable with scale, and call PCA for a sequence of \\(1,\\dots,3\\) criminality scores that best separate between states. USArrests.1 &lt;- USArrests[,-3] %&gt;% scale pca.1 &lt;- prcomp(USArrests.1, scale = TRUE) pca.1 ## Standard deviations (1, .., p=3): ## [1] 1.5357670 0.6767949 0.4282154 ## ## Rotation (n x k) = (3 x 3): ## PC1 PC2 PC3 ## Murder -0.5826006 0.5339532 -0.6127565 ## Assault -0.6079818 0.2140236 0.7645600 ## Rape -0.5393836 -0.8179779 -0.1999436 Things to note and terminology: Distinguishing between states, i.e., finding the variance maximizing scores, should be indifferent to the average of each variable. We also don’t want the score to be sensitive to the measurement scale. Formally, we say we want the scores to be affine invariant. We thus perform PCA in the z-score scale of each variable, obtained with the scale function. PCA is performed with the prcomp function. It returns the contribution (weight) of the original variables, to the new crimeness score. These weights are called the loadings . Z-scored loadings are known as Rotations, which is also the term in the prcomp output. If you are confused between loadings and rotations, see this Cross Validated entry. The number of possible scores, is the same as the number of original variables in the data. The new scores are called the principal components, labeled PC1,…,PC3 in our output. They are computed by summing the original variables weighted by their loadings. The loadings/rotation on PC1 tell us that the best separation between states is along the average crime rate. Why is this? Because all the \\(3\\) crime variables have a similar loading on PC1. The other PCs are slightly harder to interpret, but it is an interesting exercise. If we now represent each state, not with its original \\(4\\) variables, but only with the first \\(2\\) PCs (for example), we have reduced the dimensionality of the data. 10.1.1.1 Mathematics of PCA What is the mathematical problem that is actually solved with PCA? Finding a linear combination (\\(v\\)) of the original variables (\\(x\\)), so that the new score/index (\\(v&#39;x\\)) best separates individuals. Best separation implies that the variance of \\(v&#39;x\\) is maximal. Clearly, \\(Var[v&#39;x]\\) may explode if any \\(v\\) is allowed, so we need to pick \\(v\\) from some “fair” set. It is most convenient, mathematically, to constrain the \\(l_2\\) norm to some constant: \\(\\Vert v \\Vert^2_2=\\sum v_j^2=1\\). The first “best separating score”, known as the first principal component (PC), is thus \\[v_1&#39;x \\quad s.t. \\quad v_1=argmax_{v}\\{Var[v&#39;x], \\text{ and } \\Vert v \\Vert_2=1 \\} .\\] The second PC, is the same, only that it is required to be orthogonal to the first PC: \\[v_2&#39;x \\quad s.t. \\quad v_2=argmax_{v}\\{Var[v&#39;x], \\text{ and } \\Vert v \\Vert_2=1, \\text{ and } v&#39;v_1=0 \\} .\\] The construction of the next PCs follows the same lines: find a linear transformation of the data that best separates observations and is orthogonal to the previous PCs. 10.1.1.2 How Hard is the PCA Problem? Estimating all the PCs in the data is well defined algebraically if \\(n&gt;p\\), in which case \\(p\\) PCs are computable. This is the algebraic part of the problem, which is rather easy, and solved with SVD. If viewing PCA as inference tool, we may ask about its statistical performance. It turns out that PCA has the same statistical difficulty as estimating a covariance matrix. As we already saw in the Multivariate Statistics Chapter (8), estimating covariances is a hard task, we thus recommend: don’t trust your PCs if \\(n\\) is not much larger than \\(p\\), and see the bibliographic notes for further details. 10.1.2 Dimensionality Reduction Preliminaries Before presenting methods other than PCA, we need some terminology. Variable: A.k.a. dimension, or feature, or column. A vector of \\(p\\) measurements in their raw scale. Feature Mapping: A.k.a. variable transformation, or data augmentation. A measurement in a new, transformed, scale. Data: A.k.a. sample, observations. Will typically consist of \\(n\\), vectors of dimension \\(p\\). We typically denote the data as a \\(n\\times p\\) matrix \\(X\\). Data space: A.k.a. feature space. The space of all possible values of \\(X\\). We denote with \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). Network: A representation of the similarities (or dissimilarities) between the \\(n\\) units in the data. We denote with \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), and may be encoded in an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix. Manifold: A generalization of a linear space, which is regular enough so that, locally, it has all the properties of a linear space. We will denote an arbitrary manifold by \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), and by \\(\\mathcal{M}_q\\) a \\(q\\) dimensional22 manifold. Embedding: Informally speaking: a “shape preserving” mapping (see figure below). We denote an embedding of the data \\(X\\), into a manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) by \\(X\\mapsto \\mathcal{M}\\). Embedding Function: If the embedding is not only an algorithm, but rather, has a functional form representation, we call it an embedding function \\(f\\). Given such a function, we are not restricted to embeddings of the original data, \\(X\\), but may also embed new data points from \\(\\mathcal{X}\\): \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\mapsto\\mathcal{M}\\). Generative Model: Known to statisticians as the sampling distribution. The assumed stochastic process that generated the observed \\(X\\). Various embedding algorithms. No embedding of the sphere to the plane is perfect. This is obviously not new. Maps makers have known this for centuries!Source: http://sci kit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/manifold/plot_manifold_sphere.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-manifold-plot-manifold-sphere-py There are many motivations for dimensionality reduction: Scoring: Give each observation an interpretable, simple score (Hotelling’s motivation). Latent structure: Recover unobservable information from indirect measurements. E.g: Blind signal reconstruction, CT scan, cryo-electron microscopy, etc. Signal to Noise: Denoise measurements before further processing like clustering, supervised learning, etc. Compression: Save on RAM ,CPU, and communication when operating on a lower dimensional representation of the data. 10.1.3 Latent Variable Generative Approaches All generative approaches to dimensionality reduction will include a set of latent/unobservable variables, which we can try to recover from the observables \\(X\\). The unobservable variables will typically have a lower dimension than the observables, thus, dimension is reduced. We start with the simplest case of linear Factor Analysis. 10.1.3.1 Factor Analysis (FA) FA originates from the psychometric literature. We thus revisit the IQ (actually g-factor23) Example 10.2: Example 10.4 Assume \\(n\\) respondents answer \\(p\\) quantitative questions: \\(x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p, i=1,\\dots,n\\). Also assume, their responses are some linear function of a single personality attribute, \\(s_i\\). We can think of \\(s_i\\) as the subject’s “intelligence”. We thus have \\[\\begin{align} x_i = s_i A + \\varepsilon_i \\end{align}\\] And in matrix notation: \\[\\begin{align} X = S A+\\varepsilon, \\tag{10.1} \\end{align}\\] where \\(A\\) is the \\(q \\times p\\) matrix of factor loadings, and \\(S\\) the \\(n \\times q\\) matrix of latent personality traits. In our particular example where \\(q=1\\), the problem is to recover the unobservable intelligence scores, \\(s_1,\\dots,s_n\\), from the observed answers \\(X\\). We may try to estimate \\(S A\\) by assuming some distribution on \\(S\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\) and apply maximum likelihood. Under standard assumptions on the distribution of \\(S\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\), recovering \\(S\\) from \\(\\widehat{S A }\\) is still impossible as there are infinitely many such solutions. In the statistical parlance we say the problem is non identifiable, and in the applied mathematics parlance we say the problem is ill posed. Remark. The non-uniqueness (non-identifiability) of the FA solution under variable rotation is never mentioned in the PCA context. Why is this? This is because the methods solve different problems. The reason the solution to PCA is well defined is that PCA does not seek a single \\(S\\) but rather a sequence of \\(S_q\\) with dimensions growing from \\(q=1\\) to \\(q=p\\). The FA terminology is slightly different than PCA: Factors: The unobserved attributes \\(S\\). Akin to the principal components in PCA. Loading: The \\(A\\) matrix; the contribution of each factor to the observed \\(X\\). Rotation: An arbitrary orthogonal re-combination of the factors, \\(S\\), and loadings, \\(A\\), which changes the interpretation of the result. The FA literature offers several heuristics to “fix” the identifiability problem of FA. These are known as rotations, and go under the names of Varimax, Quartimax, Equimax, Oblimin, Promax, and possibly others. Because of their great similarity, FA is often confused with PCA. For a discussion of the similarities and dissimilarities, see this excellent StackExchange Q. 10.1.3.2 Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Like FA, independent compoent analysis (ICA) is a family of latent space models, thus, a meta-method. It assumes data is generated as some function of the latent variables \\(S\\). In many cases this function is assumed to be linear in \\(S\\) so that ICA is compared, if not confused, with PCA and even more so with FA. The fundamental idea of ICA is that \\(S\\) has a joint distribution of non-Gaussian, independent variables. This independence assumption, solves the the non-uniqueness of \\(S\\) in FA. As such, it can be thought of as a type of rotation in FA. Then again, if the assumed distribution of \\(S\\) is both non-Gaussian, and well justified, then ICA is well defined, and more than just an arbitrary rotation of FA. Being a generative model, estimation of \\(S\\) can then be done using maximum likelihood, or other estimation principles. ICA is a popular technique in signal processing, where \\(A\\) is actually the signal, such as sound in Example 10.3. Recovering \\(A\\) is thus recovering the original signals mixing in the recorded \\(X\\). 10.1.4 Purely Algorithmic Approaches We now discuss dimensionality reduction approaches that are not stated via their generative model, but rather, directly as an algorithm. This does not mean that they cannot be cast via their generative model, but rather they were not motivated as such. 10.1.4.1 Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) MDS can be thought of as a variation on PCA, that begins with the \\(n \\times n\\) graph of distances between data points \\(\\mathcal{G}\\); In contrast to PCA which operates on the original \\(n \\times p\\) data \\(X\\). The term graph is typically used in this context, but saying network instead of graph is more appropriate. This is because a graph encodes connections (topology) and networks encode distances (geometry). Put differently, a graph can be encoded in a matrix of zeroes and ones, and a network with real numbers. MDS aims at embedding \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) into the plane, typically for visualization, while preserving the original distances. Basic results in graph/network theory suggest that the geometry of a graph cannot be preserved when embedding it into lower dimensions (Graham 1988). The different types of MDSs, such as Classical MDS, and Sammon Mappings, differ in the stress function that penalizes for the geometric distortion caused by the embedding. 10.1.4.2 Local Multidimensional Scaling (Local MDS) Example 10.5 Consider data of coordinates on the globe. At short distances, constructing a dissimilarity graph with Euclidean distances will capture the true distance between points. At long distances, however, the Euclidean distances as grossly inappropriate. A more extreme example is coordinates on the brain’s cerebral cortex. Being a highly folded surface, the Euclidean distance between points is far from the true geodesic distances along the cortex’s surface24. Local MDS is aimed at solving the case where Euclidean distances are inappropriate. Instead of using the graph of Euclidean distances between any two points, \\(\\mathcal{G}=X&#39;X\\), local MDS computes \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) starting with the Euclidean distance between pairs of nearest points. Longer distances are solved as a shortest path problem. This is akin to computing the distance between Jerusalem to Beijing by computing Euclidean distances between Jerusalem-Bagdad, Bagdad-Teheran, Teheran-Ashgabat, Ashgabat-Tashkent,and so on. Because the geographical-distance between these cities is well approximated with the Euclidean distance, summing local distanes is better than operating with the Euclidean distance between Jerusalem and Beijing. After computing \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), local MDS ends with the usual MDS for the embedding. Because local MDS ends with a regular MDS, it can be seen as a non-linear embedding into a linear manifold \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). 10.1.4.3 Isometric Feature Mapping (IsoMap) Like localMDS, only that the embedding, and not only the computation of the distances, is local. 10.1.4.4 Local Linear Embedding (LLE) Very similar to IsoMap 10.1.4.3. 10.1.4.5 Kernel PCA (kPCA) Returning to the BMI example (10.1); what if we want to learn scores that best separate between individuals, but unlike PCA, are non-linear in the original features. Kernel PCA does just that, only that it restricts the possible scores to simple functions of the original variables. The allowed functions resides in a function space called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), this giving kPCA it’s name. 10.1.4.6 Sparse PCA (sPCA) sPCA is a type of PCA where the loadings are sparse. This means that PCs are linear combinations of a small number of variables. This makes sPCA easier to interpret. Note that the varimax rotation of factor-analysis has a similar goal: create factors with minimally contributing variables, so that they are easy to explain. 10.1.4.7 Sparse kernel PCA (skPCA) A marriage between sPCA and kPCA: generate scores that are non linear transformations of a minimal number of variables, each. 10.1.4.8 Correspondence Analysis (CA) What if \\(x\\) is not continuous, i.e., \\(\\mathcal{X}\\neq \\mathbb{R}^p\\)? We could dummy-code \\(x\\), and then use plain PCA. A more principled view, when \\(x\\) is categorical, is that of Correspondence Analysis. 10.1.5 Dimensionality Reduction in R 10.1.5.1 PCA We already saw the basics of PCA in 10.1.1. The fitting is done with the prcomp function. The bi-plot is a useful way to visualize the output of PCA. # library(devtools) # install_github(&quot;vqv/ggbiplot&quot;) ggbiplot::ggbiplot(pca.1) Things to note: We used the ggbiplot function from the ggbiplot (available from github, but not from CRAN), because it has a nicer output than stats::biplot. The bi-plot also plots the loadings as arrows. The coordinates of the arrows belong to the weight of each of the original variables in each PC. For example, the x-value of each arrow is the loadings on the first PC (on the x-axis). Since the weights of Murder, Assault, and Rape are almost the same, we conclude that PC1 captures the average crime rate in each state. The bi-plot plots each data point along its PCs. The scree plot depicts the quality of the approximation of \\(X\\) as \\(q\\) grows, i.e., as we add more and more PCs to explain the data. This is depicted using the proportion of variability in \\(X\\) that is removed by each added PC. It is customary to choose \\(q\\) as the first PC that has a relative low contribution to the approximation of \\(X\\). This is known as the “knee heuristic”. ggbiplot::ggscreeplot(pca.1) See how the first PC captures the variability in the Assault levels and Murder levels, with a single score.

The Principal Component Analysis title is due to the fact that FA without rotations, is equivalent to PCA. The first factor (fa.1$loadings) has different weights than the first PC (pca.1$rotation) because of normalization. They are the same, however, in that the first PC, and the first factor, capture average crime levels. Graphical model fans will like the following plot, where the contribution of each variable to each factor is encoded in the width of the arrow. qgraph::qgraph(fa.1) Let’s add a rotation (Varimax), and note that the rotation has indeed changed the loadings of the variables, thus the interpretation of the factors. fa.2 &lt;- psych::principal(USArrests.1, nfactors = 2, rotate = &quot;varimax&quot;) fa.2$loadings ## ## Loadings: ## RC1 RC2 ## Murder 0.930 0.257 ## Assault 0.829 0.453 ## Rape 0.321 0.943 ## ## RC1 RC2 ## SS loadings 1.656 1.160 ## Proportion Var 0.552 0.387 ## Cumulative Var 0.552 0.939 Things to note: FA with a rotation is no longer equivalent to PCA. The rotated factors are now called rotated componentes, and reported in RC1 and RC2. 10.1.5.3 ICA ica.1 &lt;- fastICA::fastICA(USArrests.1, n.com=2) # Also performs projection pursuit plot(ica.1$S) abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2) text(ica.1$S, pos = 4, labels = rownames(USArrests.1)) # Compare with PCA (first two PCs): arrows(x0 = ica.1$S[,1], y0 = ica.1$S[,2], x1 = pca.1$x[,2], y1 = pca.1$x[,1], col=&#39;red&#39;, pch=19, cex=0.5) Things to note: ICA is fitted with fastICA::fastICA. The ICA components, like any other rotated components, are different than the PCA components. 10.1.5.4 MDS Classical MDS, also compared with PCA. # We first need a dissimarity matrix/graph: state.disimilarity &lt;- dist(USArrests.1) mds.1 &lt;- cmdscale(state.disimilarity) plot(mds.1, pch = 19) abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2) USArrests.2 &lt;- USArrests[,1:2] %&gt;% scale text(mds.1, pos = 4, labels = rownames(USArrests.2), col = &#39;tomato&#39;) # Compare with PCA (first two PCs): points(pca.1$x[,1:2], col=&#39;red&#39;, pch=19, cex=0.5) Things to note: We first compute a dissimilarity graph with dist. See the cluster::daisy function for more dissimilarity measures. We learn the MDS embedding with cmdscale. The embedding of PCA is the same as classical MDS with Euclidean distances. Let’s try other strain functions for MDS, like Sammon’s strain, and compare it with the PCs. mds.2 &lt;- MASS::sammon(state.disimilarity, trace = FALSE) plot(mds.2$points, pch = 19) abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2) text(mds.2$points, pos = 4, labels = rownames(USArrests.2)) # Compare with PCA (first two PCs): arrows( x0 = mds.2$points[,1], y0 = mds.2$points[,2], x1 = pca.1$x[,1], y1 = pca.1$x[,2], col=&#39;red&#39;, pch=19, cex=0.5) Things to note: MASS::sammon does the embedding. Sammon strain is different than PCA. 10.1.5.5 Sparse PCA # Compute similarity graph state.similarity &lt;- MASS::cov.rob(USArrests.1)$cov spca1 &lt;- elasticnet::spca(state.similarity, K=2, type=&quot;Gram&quot;, sparse=&quot;penalty&quot;, trace=FALSE, para=c(0.06,0.16)) spca1$loadings ## PC1 PC2 ## Murder -0.6503748 0 ## Assault -0.7452769 0 ## Rape -0.1468840 1 Things to note: I used the spca function in the elasticnet package. Is the solutions sparse? Yes! PC2 depends on a single variable only: Murder. 10.1.5.6 Kernel PCA library(kernlab) kpc &lt;- kpca(~.,data=as.data.frame(USArrests.1), kernel=&quot;rbfdot&quot;, kpar=list(sigma=0.2), features=2) plot(rotated(kpc), xlab=&quot;1st Principal Component&quot;, ylab=&quot;2nd Principal Component&quot;) abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2) text(rotated(kpc), pos = 4, labels = rownames(USArrests.2)) Things to note: kPCA is implemented in kernlab::kpca. kernel= governs the class of variable mappings allowed for the scoring. See ?'kpca-class' or ?rotated for help on available utility functions. rotated projects the data on its principal components (the above “scores”). kpar=list(sigma=0.2) provides parameters specific to each type of kernel. See ?kpca. features=2 is the number of principal components (scores) to learn. You may notice the “Horseshoe” pattern of the kPCA embedding, a.k.a. “Croissants”, or the Guttman Effect. The horseshoe is a recurring and old phenomenon. This phenomenon implies that the data has “structure”. Alas, it is possible that this structure is merely due to the sampling scheme that introduced correlations. See J. De Leeuw’s online paper for a review. 10.1.5.7 MCA See Izenman (2008). 10.2 Clustering Example 10.6 Consider the tagging of your friends’ pictures on Facebook. If you tagged some pictures, Facebook may try to use a supervised approach to automatically label photos. If you never tagged pictures, a supervised approach is impossible. It is still possible, however, to group simiar pictures together. Example 10.7 Consider the problem of spam detection. It would be nice if each user could label several thousands emails, to apply a supervised learning approach to spam detection. This is an unrealistic demand, so a pre-clustering stage is useful: the user only needs to tag a couple dozens of homogenous clusters, before solving the supervised learning problem. In clustering problems, we seek to group observations that are similar. There are many motivations for clustering: Understanding: The most common use of clustering is probably as a an exploratory step, to identify homogeneous groups in the data. Dimensionality reduction: Clustering may be seen as a method for dimensionality reduction. Unlike the approaches in the Dimensionality Reduction Section 10.1, it does not compress variables but rather observations. Each group of homogeneous observations may then be represented as a single prototypical observation of the group. Pre-Labelling: Clustering may be performed as a pre-processing step for supervised learning, when labeling all the samples is impossible due to “budget” constraints, like in Example 10.7. This is sometimes known as pre-clustering. Clustering, like dimensionality reduction, may rely on some latent variable generative model, or on purely algorithmic approaches. 10.2.1 Latent Variable Generative Approaches 10.2.1.1 Finite Mixture Example 10.8 Consider the distribution of heights. Heights have a nice bell shaped distribution within each gender. If genders have not been recorded, heights will be distributed like a mixture of males and females. The gender in this example, is a latent variable taking \\(K=2\\) levels: male and female. A finite mixture is the marginal distribution of \\(K\\) distinct classes, when the class variable is latent. This is useful for clustering: We can assume the number of classes, \\(K\\), and the distribution of each class. We then use maximum likelihood to fit the mixture distribution, and finally, cluster by assigning observations to the most probable class. 10.2.2 Purely Algorithmic Approaches 10.2.2.1 K-Means The K-means algorithm is possibly the most popular clustering algorithm. The goal behind K-means clustering is finding a representative point for each of K clusters, and assign each data point to one of these clusters. As each cluster has a representative point, this is also a prototype method. The clusters are defined so that they minimize the average Euclidean distance between all points to the center of the cluster. In K-means, the clusters are first defined, and then similarities computed. This is thus a top-down method. K-means clustering requires the raw features \\(X\\) as inputs, and not only a similarity graph. This is evident when examining the algorithm below. The k-means algorithm works as follows: Choose the number of clusters \\(K\\). Arbitrarily assign points to clusters. While clusters keep changing: Compute the cluster centers as the average of their points. Assign each point to its closest cluster center (in Euclidean distance). Return Cluster assignments and means. Remark. If trained as a statistician, you may wonder- what population quantity is K-means actually estimating? The estimand of K-means is known as the K principal points. Principal points are points which are self consistent, i.e., they are the mean of their neighbourhood. 10.2.2.2 K-Means++ K-means++ is a fast version of K-means thanks to a smart initialization. 10.2.2.3 K-Medoids If a Euclidean distance is inappropriate for a particular set of variables, or that robustness to corrupt observations is required, or that we wish to constrain the cluster centers to be actual observations, then the K-Medoids algorithm is an adaptation of K-means that allows this. It is also known under the name partition around medoids (PAM) clustering, suggesting its relation to graph partitioning. The k-medoids algorithm works as follows. Given a dissimilarity graph. Choose the number of clusters \\(K\\). Arbitrarily assign points to clusters. While clusters keep changing: Within each cluster, set the center as the data point that minimizes the sum of distances to other points in the cluster. Assign each point to its closest cluster center. Return Cluster assignments and centers. Remark. If trained as a statistician, you may wonder- what population quantity is K-medoids actually estimating? The estimand of K-medoids is the median of their neighbourhood. A delicate matter is that quantiles are not easy to define for multivariate variables so that the “multivaraitre median”, may be a more subtle quantity than you may think. See Small (1990). 10.2.2.4 Hirarchial Clustering Hierarchical clustering algorithms take dissimilarity graphs as inputs. Hierarchical clustering is a class of greedy graph-partitioning algorithms. Being hierarchical by design, they have the attractive property that the evolution of the clustering can be presented with a dendogram, i.e., a tree plot. A particular advantage of these methods is that they do not require an a-priori choice of the number of cluster (\\(K\\)). Two main sub-classes of algorithms are agglomerative, and divisive. Agglomerative clustering algorithms are bottom-up algorithm which build clusters by joining smaller clusters. To decide which clusters are joined at each iteration some measure of closeness between clusters is required. Single Linkage: Cluster distance is defined by the distance between the two closest members. Complete Linkage: Cluster distance is defined by the distance between the two farthest members. Group Average: Cluster distance is defined by the average distance between members. Group Median: Like Group Average, only using the median. Divisive clustering algorithms are top-down algorithm which build clusters by splitting larger clusters. 10.2.2.5 Fuzzy Clustering Can be thought of as a purely algorithmic view of the finite-mixture in Section 10.2.1.1. 10.2.3 Clustering in R 10.2.3.1 K-Means The following code is an adaptation from David Hitchcock. k &lt;- 2 kmeans.1 &lt;- stats::kmeans(USArrests.1, centers = k) head(kmeans.1$cluster) # cluster asignments ## Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado ## 1 1 1 2 1 1 pairs(USArrests.1, panel=function(x,y) text(x,y,kmeans.1$cluster)) Things to note: The stats::kmeans function does the clustering. The cluster assignment is given in the cluster element of the stats::kmeans output. The visual inspection confirms that similar states have been assigned to the same cluster. 10.2.3.2 K-Means ++ K-Means++ is a smart initialization for K-Means. The following code is taken from the r-help mailing list. # Write my own K-means++ function. kmpp &lt;- function(X, k) { n &lt;- nrow(X) C &lt;- numeric(k) C[1] &lt;- sample(1:n, 1) for (i in 2:k) { dm &lt;- pracma::distmat(X, X[C, ]) pr &lt;- apply(dm, 1, min); pr[C] &lt;- 0 C[i] &lt;- sample(1:n, 1, prob = pr) } kmeans(X, X[C, ]) } kmeans.2 &lt;- kmpp(USArrests.1, k) head(kmeans.2$cluster) ## Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado ## 1 1 1 2 1 1 10.2.3.3 K-Medoids Start by growing a distance graph with dist and then partition using pam. state.disimilarity &lt;- dist(USArrests.1) kmed.1 &lt;- cluster::pam(x= state.disimilarity, k=2) head(kmed.1$clustering) ## Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado ## 1 1 1 1 1 1 plot(pca.1$x[,1], pca.1$x[,2], xlab=&quot;PC 1&quot;, ylab=&quot;PC 2&quot;, type =&#39;n&#39;, lwd=2) text(pca.1$x[,1], pca.1$x[,2], labels=rownames(USArrests.1), cex=0.7, lwd=2, col=kmed.1$cluster) Things to note: K-medoids starts with the computation of a dissimilarity graph, done by the dist function. The clustering is done by the cluster::pam function. Inspecting the output confirms that similar states have been assigned to the same cluster. Many other similarity measures can be found in proxy::dist(). See cluster::clara() for a big-data implementation of PAM. 10.2.3.4 Hirarchial Clustering We start with agglomerative clustering with single-linkage. hirar.1 &lt;- hclust(state.disimilarity, method=&#39;single&#39;) plot(hirar.1, labels=rownames(USArrests.1), ylab=&quot;Distance&quot;) Things to note: The clustering is done with the hclust function. We choose the single-linkage distance using the method='single' argument. We did not need to a-priori specify the number of clusters, \\(K\\), since all the possible \\(K\\)’s are included in the output tree. The plot function has a particular method for hclust class objects, and plots them as dendograms. We try other types of linkages, to verify that the indeed affect the clustering. Starting with complete linkage. hirar.2 &lt;- hclust(state.disimilarity, method=&#39;complete&#39;) plot(hirar.2, labels=rownames(USArrests.1), ylab=&quot;Distance&quot;) Now with average linkage. hirar.3 &lt;- hclust(state.disimilarity, method=&#39;average&#39;) plot(hirar.3, labels=rownames(USArrests.1), ylab=&quot;Distance&quot;) If we know how many clusters we want, we can use cuttree to get the class assignments. cut.2.2 &lt;- cutree(hirar.2, k=2) head(cut.2.2) ## Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado ## 1 1 1 2 1 1 How to choose the number of clusters? Just like the Scree Plot above, we can use a “knee heuristic”. Because the length of a tree’s branch is proportional to distances, long branches imply inhomogenous groups, while short branches imply homogeneous groups. Here is a little simulation to demonstrate this: n.groups &lt;- 3 data.p &lt;- 10 data.n &lt;- 100 # data with no separation between groups the.data.10 &lt;- mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n = data.n, mean = rep(0,data.p)) data.disimilarity.10 &lt;- dist(the.data.10) hirar.10 &lt;- hclust(data.disimilarity.10, method = &quot;complete&quot;) plot(hirar.10, ylab=&quot;Distance&quot;, main=&#39;All from the same group&#39;) # data with strong separation between groups the.data.11 &lt;-the.data.10 +sample(c(0,10,20), data.n, replace=TRUE) # Shift each group data.disimilarity.11 &lt;- dist(the.data.11) hirar.11 &lt;- hclust(data.disimilarity.11, method = &quot;complete&quot;) plot(hirar.11, ylab=&quot;Distance&quot;, main=paste(&#39;Strong Separation Between&#39;,n.groups, &#39;Groups&#39;)) 10.3 Bibliographic Notes For more on PCA see my Dimensionality Reduction Class Notes and references therein. Another excellent reference on multivariate analysis (exploratory and inference) is Izenman (2008). For an excellent book on kernel methods (RKHS) see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004). For more on everything, see Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2001). For a softer introduction (to everything), see James et al. (2013). 10.4 Practice Yourself Generate data from multivariate Gaussian data with mvtnorm::rmvnorm(). Clearly this data has no structure at all: it is a \\(p\\)-dimensional shapeless cloud of \\(n\\) points. Now try various dimensionality reduction algorithms such as PCA, MDS, kPCA, sPCA. How does the sphere map to the plane? How does the mapping depend on \\(n\\)? And on \\(p\\)? Map the data to a \\(p\\)-dimensional unit sphere by dividing each observation with its \\(l_2\\) norm: map2sphere &lt;- function(x) x/sqrt(sum(x^2)). Repeat the previous embeddings. Does this structureless data embeds itself with structure? Introduce artificial “structure” in the data and repeat the previous exercise. Use the Factor Analysis generative model in Eq.((10.1)) to generate \\(p\\) dimensional data along a one-dimensional line. Can you see that observations arrange themselves along a single line in after your plane embedding? Read about the Iris dataset using ?iris. “Forget” the Species column to make the problem unsupervised. Make pairs of scatter plots. Can you identify the clusters in the data? Perform K-means with centers=3. To extract the clustering results (cluster of each instance) use kmeans$clusters. Now recall the Species column to verify your clustering. Perform hierarchical clustering with hclust, method=”single” and method=”average”.Extract the clustering results with cutree. Compare the accuracy of the two linkage methods. Perform PCA on the data with prcomp function. Print the Rotation matrix. Print the PCA’s vectors with pca$x. These vectors are the new values for each instance in the dataset after the rotation. Let’s look at the first component (PC1) with plot(pca$x[,1]) (i.e reduce the dimensionality from 4 to 1 features). Can you identify visually the three clusters (species)? Determine the color of the points to be the truth species with col=iris$Species. References "],
["plotting.html", "Chapter 11 Plotting 11.1 The graphics System 11.2 The ggplot2 System 11.3 Interactive Graphics 11.4 Bibliographic Notes 11.5 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 11 Plotting Whether you are doing EDA, or preparing your results for publication, you need plots. R has many plotting mechanisms, allowing the user a tremendous amount of flexibility, while abstracting away a lot of the tedious details. To be concrete, many of the plots in R are simply impossible to produce with Excel, SPSS, or SAS, and would take a tremendous amount of work to produce with Python, Java and lower level programming languages. In this text, we will focus on two plotting packages. The basic graphics package, distributed with the base R distribution, and the ggplot2 package. Before going into the details of the plotting packages, we start with some philosophy. The graphics package originates from the mainframe days. Computers had no graphical interface, and the output of the plot was immediately sent to a printer. Once a plot has been produced with the graphics package, just like a printed output, it cannot be queried nor changed, except for further additions. The philosophy of R is that everyting is an object. The graphics package does not adhere to this philosophy, and indeed it was soon augmented with the grid package (R Core Team 2016), that treats plots as objects. grid is a low level graphics interface, and users may be more familiar with the lattice package built upon it (Sarkar 2008). lattice is very powerful, but soon enough, it was overtaken in popularity by the ggplot2 package (Wickham 2009). ggplot2 was the PhD project of Hadley Wickham, a name to remember… Two fundamental ideas underlay ggplot2: (i) everything is an object, and (ii), plots can be described by a simple grammar, i.e., a language to describe the building blocks of the plot. The grammar in ggplot2 are is the one stated by L. Wilkinson (2006). The objects and grammar of ggplot2 have later evolved to allow more complicated plotting and in particular, interactive plotting. Interactive plotting is a very important feature for EDA, and reporting. The major leap in interactive plotting was made possible by the advancement of web technologies, such as JavaScript and D3.JS. Why is this? Because an interactive plot, or report, can be seen as a web-site. Building upon the capabilities of JavaScript and your web browser to provide the interactivity, greatly facilitates the development of such plots, as the programmer can rely on the web-browsers capabilities for interactivity. 11.1 The graphics System The R code from the Basics Chapter 3 is a demonstration of the graphics package and plotting system. We make a quick review of the basics. 11.1.1 Using Existing Plotting Functions 11.1.1.1 Scatter Plot A simple scatter plot. attach(trees) plot(Girth ~ Height) Various types of plots. par.old &lt;- par(no.readonly = TRUE) par(mfrow=c(2,3)) plot(Girth, type=&#39;h&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;h&#39;&quot;) plot(Girth, type=&#39;o&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;o&#39;&quot;) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;l&#39;&quot;) plot(Girth, type=&#39;s&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;s&#39;&quot;) plot(Girth, type=&#39;b&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;b&#39;&quot;) plot(Girth, type=&#39;p&#39;, main=&quot;type=&#39;p&#39;&quot;) par(par.old) Things to note: The par command controls the plotting parameters. mfrow=c(2,3) is used to produce a matrix of plots with 2 rows and 3 columns. The par.old object saves the original plotting setting. It is restored after plotting using par(par.old). The type argument controls the type of plot. The main argument controls the title. See ?plot and ?par for more options. Control the plotting characters with the pch argument, and size with the cex argument. plot(Girth, pch=&#39;+&#39;, cex=3) Control the line’s type with lty argument, and width with lwd. par(mfrow=c(2,3)) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=1, lwd=2) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=2, lwd=2) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=3, lwd=2) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=4, lwd=2) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=5, lwd=2) plot(Girth, type=&#39;l&#39;, lty=6, lwd=2) Add line by slope and intercept with abline. plot(Girth) abline(v=14, col=&#39;red&#39;) # vertical line at 14. abline(h=9, lty=4,lwd=4, col=&#39;pink&#39;) # horizontal line at 9. abline(a = 0, b=1) # linear line with intercept a=0, and slope b=1. plot(Girth) points(x=1:30, y=rep(12,30), cex=0.5, col=&#39;darkblue&#39;) lines(x=rep(c(5,10), 7), y=7:20, lty=2 ) lines(x=rep(c(5,10), 7)+2, y=7:20, lty=2 ) lines(x=rep(c(5,10), 7)+4, y=7:20, lty=2 , col=&#39;darkgreen&#39;) lines(x=rep(c(5,10), 7)+6, y=7:20, lty=4 , col=&#39;brown&#39;, lwd=4) Things to note: points adds points on an existing plot. lines adds lines on an existing plot. col controls the color of the element. It takes names or numbers as argument. cex controls the scale of the element. Defaults to cex=1. Add other elements. plot(Girth) segments(x0=rep(c(5,10), 7), y0=7:20, x1=rep(c(5,10), 7)+2, y1=(7:20)+2 ) # line segments arrows(x0=13,y0=16,x1=16,y1=17) # arrows rect(xleft=10, ybottom=12, xright=12, ytop=16) # rectangle polygon(x=c(10,11,12,11.5,10.5), y=c(9,9.5,10,10.5,9.8), col=&#39;grey&#39;) # polygon title(main=&#39;This plot makes no sense&#39;, sub=&#39;Or does it?&#39;) mtext(&#39;Printing in the margins&#39;, side=2) # math text mtext(expression(alpha==log(f[i])), side=4) Things to note: The following functions add the elements they are named after: segments, arrows, rect, polygon, title. mtext adds mathematical text, which needs to be wrapped in expression(). For more information for mathematical annotation see ?plotmath. Add a legend. plot(Girth, pch=&#39;G&#39;,ylim=c(8,77), xlab=&#39;Tree number&#39;, ylab=&#39;&#39;, type=&#39;b&#39;, col=&#39;blue&#39;) points(Volume, pch=&#39;V&#39;, type=&#39;b&#39;, col=&#39;red&#39;) legend(x=2, y=70, legend=c(&#39;Girth&#39;, &#39;Volume&#39;), pch=c(&#39;G&#39;,&#39;V&#39;), col=c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;), bg=&#39;grey&#39;) Adjusting Axes with xlim and ylim. plot(Girth, xlim=c(0,15), ylim=c(8,12)) Use layout for complicated plot layouts. A&lt;-matrix(c(1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6), byrow=TRUE, ncol=2) layout(A,heights=c(1/14,6/14,1/14,6/14)) oma.saved &lt;- par(&quot;oma&quot;) par(oma = rep.int(0, 4)) par(oma = oma.saved) o.par &lt;- par(mar = rep.int(0, 4)) for (i in seq_len(6)) { plot.new() box() text(0.5, 0.5, paste(&#39;Box no.&#39;,i), cex=3) } Always detach. detach(trees) 11.1.2 Exporting a Plot The pipeline for exporting graphics is similar to the export of data. Instead of the write.table or save functions, we will use the pdf, tiff, png, functions. Depending on the type of desired output. Check and set the working directory. getwd() setwd(&quot;/tmp/&quot;) Export tiff. tiff(filename=&#39;graphicExample.tiff&#39;) plot(rnorm(100)) dev.off() Things to note: The tiff function tells R to open a .tiff file, and write the output of a plot. Only a single (the last) plot is saved. dev.off to close the tiff device, and return the plotting to the R console (or RStudio). If you want to produce several plots, you can use a counter in the file’s name.

Recall, in ggplot2, a plot is a object. It can be queried, it can be changed, and among other things, it can be plotted. ggplot2 provides a convenience function for many plots: qplot. We take a non-typical approach by ignoring qplot, and presenting the fundamental building blocks. Once the building blocks have been understood, mastering qplot will be easy. The following is taken from UCLA’s idre. A ggplot2 object will have the following elements: Data the data frame holding the data to be plotted. Aes defines the mapping between variables to their visualization. Geoms are the objects/shapes you add as layers to your graph. Stats are statistical transformations when you are not plotting the raw data, such as the mean or confidence intervals. Faceting splits the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling). The nlme::Milk dataset has the protein level of various cows, at various times, with various diets. library(nlme) data(Milk) head(Milk) ## Grouped Data: protein ~ Time | Cow ## protein Time Cow Diet ## 1 3.63 1 B01 barley ## 2 3.57 2 B01 barley ## 3 3.47 3 B01 barley ## 4 3.65 4 B01 barley ## 5 3.89 5 B01 barley ## 6 3.73 6 B01 barley library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point() Things to note: The ggplot function is the constructor of the ggplot2 object. If the object is not assigned, it is plotted. The aes argument tells R that the Time variable in the Milk data is the x axis, and protein is y. The geom_point defines the Geom, i.e., it tells R to plot the points as they are (and not lines, histograms, etc.). The ggplot2 object is build by compounding its various elements separated by the + operator. All the variables that we will need are assumed to be in the Milk data frame. This means that (a) the data needs to be a data frame (not a matrix for instance), and (b) we will not be able to use variables that are not in the Milk data frame. Let’s add some color. ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point(aes(color=Diet)) The color argument tells R to use the variable Diet as the coloring. A legend is added by default. If we wanted a fixed color, and not a variable dependent color, color would have been put outside the aes function. ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point(color=&quot;green&quot;) Let’s save the ggplot2 object so we can reuse it. Notice it is not plotted. p &lt;- ggplot(data = Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point() We can change^{In the Object-Oriented Programming lingo, this is known as mutating} existing plots using the + operator. Here, we add a smoothing line to the plot p. p + geom_smooth(method = &#39;gam&#39;) Things to note: The smoothing line is a layer added with the geom_smooth() function. Lacking arguments of its own, the new layer will inherit the aes of the original object, x and y variables in particular. To split the plot along some variable, we use faceting, done with the facet_wrap function. p + facet_wrap(~Diet) Instead of faceting, we can add a layer of the mean of each Diet subgroup, connected by lines. p + stat_summary(aes(color=Diet), fun.y=&quot;mean&quot;, geom=&quot;line&quot;) Things to note: stat_summary adds a statistical summary. The summary is applied along Diet subgroups, because of the color=Diet aesthetic, which has already split the data. The summary to be applied is the mean, because of fun.y=&quot;mean&quot;. The group means are connected by lines, because of the geom=&quot;line&quot; argument. What layers can be added using the geoms family of functions? geom_bar: bars with bases on the x-axis. geom_boxplot: boxes-and-whiskers. geom_errorbar: T-shaped error bars. geom_histogram: histogram. geom_line: lines. geom_point: points (scatterplot). geom_ribbon: bands spanning y-values across a range of x-values. geom_smooth: smoothed conditional means (e.g. loess smooth). To demonstrate the layers added with the geoms_* functions, we start with a histogram. pro &lt;- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein)) pro + geom_histogram(bins=30) A bar plot. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Diet)) + geom_bar() A scatter plot. tp &lt;- ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) tp + geom_point() A smooth regression plot, reusing the tp object. tp + geom_smooth(method=&#39;gam&#39;) And now, a simple line plot, reusing the tp object, and connecting lines along Cow. tp + geom_line(aes(group=Cow)) The line plot is completely incomprehensible. Better look at boxplots along time (even if omitting the Cow information). tp + geom_boxplot(aes(group=Time)) We can do some statistics for each subgroup. The following will compute the mean and standard errors of protein at each time point. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + stat_summary(fun.data = &#39;mean_se&#39;) Some popular statistical summaries, have gained their own functions: mean_cl_boot: mean and bootstrapped confidence interval (default 95%). mean_cl_normal: mean and Gaussian (t-distribution based) confidence interval (default 95%). mean_dsl: mean plus or minus standard deviation times some constant (default constant=2). median_hilow: median and outer quantiles (default outer quantiles = 0.025 and 0.975). For less popular statistical summaries, we may specify the statistical function in stat_summary. The median is a first example. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + stat_summary(fun.y=&quot;median&quot;, geom=&quot;point&quot;) We can also define our own statistical summaries. medianlog &lt;- function(y) {median(log(y))} ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + stat_summary(fun.y=&quot;medianlog&quot;, geom=&quot;line&quot;) Faceting allows to split the plotting along some variable. face_wrap tells R to compute the number of columns and rows of plots automatically. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=protein, color=Diet)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~Time) facet_grid forces the plot to appear allow rows or columns, using the ~ syntax. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(Diet~.) # `.~Diet` to split along columns and not rows. To control the looks of the plot, ggplot2 uses themes. ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point() + theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill=&quot;lightblue&quot;)) ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + geom_point() + theme(panel.background=element_blank(), axis.title.x=element_blank()) Saving plots can be done using ggplot2::ggsave, or with pdf like the graphics plots: pdf(file = &#39;myplot.pdf&#39;) print(tp) # You will need an explicit print command! dev.off() Finally, what every user of ggplot2 constantly uses, is the (excellent!) online documentation at http://docs.ggplot2.org. 11.2.1 Extensions of the ggplot2 System Because ggplot2 plots are R objects, they can be used for computations and altered. Many authors, have thus extended the basic ggplot2 functionality. A list of ggplot2 extensions is curated by Daniel Emaasit at http://www.ggplot2-exts.org. The RStudio team has its own list of recommended packages at RStartHere. 11.3 Interactive Graphics As already mentioned, the recent and dramatic advancement in interactive visualization was made possible by the advances in web technologies, and the D3.JS JavaScript library in particular. This is because it allows developers to rely on existing libraries designed for web browsing instead of re-implementing interactive visualizations. These libraries are more visually pleasing, and computationally efficient, than anything they could have developed themselves. The htmlwidgets package does not provide visualization, but rather, it facilitates the creation of new interactive visualizations. This is because it handles all the technical details that are required to use R output within JavaScript visualization libraries. For a list of interactive visualization tools that rely on htmlwidgets see the RStartsHere page. In the following sections, we discuss a selected subset. 11.3.1 Plotly You can create nice interactive graphs using plotly::plot_ly: library(plotly) set.seed(100) d &lt;- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ] plot_ly(data = d, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat, size = ~carat, text = ~paste(&quot;Clarity: &quot;, clarity)) More conveniently, any ggplot2 graph can be made interactive using plotly::ggplotly: p &lt;- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_smooth(aes(colour = cut, fill = cut), method = &#39;loess&#39;) + facet_wrap(~ cut) # make ggplot ggplotly(p) # from ggplot to plotly How about exporting plotly objects? Well, a plotly object is nothing more than a little web site: an HTML file. When showing a plotly figure, RStudio merely servers you as a web browser. You could, alternatively, export this HTML file to send your colleagues as an email attachment, or embed it in a web site. To export these, use the plotly::export or the htmlwidgets::saveWidget functions. For more on plotly see https://plot.ly/r/. 11.4 Bibliographic Notes For the graphics package, see R Core Team (2016). For ggplot2 see Wickham (2009). For the theory underlying ggplot2, i.e. the Grammer of Graphics, see L. Wilkinson (2006). A video by one of my heroes, Brian Caffo, discussing graphics vs. ggplot2. 11.5 Practice Yourself Go to the Fancy Graphics Section 11.1.3. Try parsing the commands in your head. Recall the medianlog example and replace the medianlog function with a harmonic mean. medianlog &lt;- function(y) {median(log(y))} ggplot(Milk, aes(x=Time, y=protein)) + stat_summary(fun.y=&quot;medianlog&quot;, geom=&quot;line&quot;) ``` Write a function that creates a boxplot from scratch. See how I built a line graph in Section 11.1.3. Export my plotly example using the RStudio interface and send it to yourself by email. ggplot2: Read about the “oats” dataset using ? MASS::oats. Inspect, visually, the dependency of the yield (Y) in the Varieties (V) and the Nitrogen treatment (N). Compute the mean and the standard error of the yield for every value of Varieties and Nitrogen treatment. Change the axis labels to be informative with labs function and give a title to the plot with ggtitle function. Read about the “mtcars” data set using ? mtcars. Inspect, visually, the dependency of the Fuel consumption (mpg) in the weight (wt) Inspect, visually, the assumption that the Fuel consumption also depends on the number of cylinders. Is there an interaction between the number of cylinders to the weight (i.e. the slope of the regression line is different between the number of cylinders)? Use geom_smooth. References "],
["report.html", "Chapter 12 Reports 12.1 knitr 12.2 bookdown 12.3 Shiny 12.4 Flexdashboard 12.5 Bibliographic Notes 12.6 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 12 Reports If you have ever written a report, you are probably familiar with the process of preparing your figures in some software, say R, and then copy-pasting into your text editor, say MS Word. While very popular, this process is both tedious, and plain painful if your data has changed and you need to update the report. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could produce figures and numbers from within the text of the report, and everything else would be automated? It turns out it is possible. There are actually several systems in R that allow this. We start with a brief review. Sweave: LaTeX is a markup language that compiles to Tex programs that compile, in turn, to documents (typically PS or PDFs). If you never heard of it, it may be because you were born the the MS Windows+MS Word era. You should know, however, that LaTeX was there much earlier, when computers were mainframes with text-only graphic devices. You should also know that LaTeX is still very popular (in some communities) due to its very rich markup syntax, and beautiful output. Sweave (Leisch 2002) is a compiler for LaTeX that allows you do insert R commands in the LaTeX source file, and get the result as part of the outputted PDF. It’s name suggests just that: it allows to weave S25 output into the document, thus, Sweave. knitr: Markdown is a text editing syntax that, unlike LaTeX, is aimed to be human-readable, but also compilable by a machine. If you ever tried to read HTML or LaTeX source files, you may understand why human-readability is a desirable property. There are many markdown compilers. One of the most popular is Pandoc, written by the Berkeley philosopher(!) Jon MacFarlane. The availability of Pandoc gave Yihui Xie, a name to remember, the idea that it is time for Sweave to evolve. Yihui thus wrote knitr (Xie 2015), which allows to write human readable text in Rmarkdown, a superset of markdown, compile it with R and the compile it with Pandoc. Because Pandoc can compile to PDF, but also to HTML, and DOCX, among others, this means that you can write in Rmarkdown, and get output in almost all text formats out there. bookdown: Bookdown (Xie 2016) is an evolution of knitr, also written by Yihui Xie, now working for RStudio. The text you are now reading was actually written in bookdown. It deals with the particular needs of writing large documents, and cross referencing in particular (which is very challenging if you want the text to be human readable). Shiny: Shiny is essentially a framework for quick web-development. It includes (i) an abstraction layer that specifies the layout of a web-site which is our report, (ii) the command to start a web server to deliver the site. For more on Shiny see Chang et al. (2017). 12.1 knitr 12.1.1 Installation To run knitr you will need to install the package. install.packages(&#39;knitr&#39;) It is also recommended that you use it within RStudio (version&gt;0.96), where you can easily create a new .Rmd file. 12.1.2 Pandoc Markdown Because knitr builds upon Pandoc markdown, here is a simple example of markdown text, to be used in a .Rmd file, which can be created using the File-&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown menu of RStudio. Underscores or asterisks for _italics1_ and *italics2* return italics1 and italics2. Double underscores or asterisks for __bold1__ and **bold2** return bold1 and bold2. Subscripts are enclosed in tildes, like~this~ (likethis), and superscripts are enclosed in carets like^this^ (likethis). For links use [text](link), like [my site](www.john-ros.com). An image is the same as a link, starting with an exclamation, like this ![image caption](image path). An itemized list simply starts with hyphens preceeded by a blank line (don’t forget that!): - bullet - bullet - second level bullet - second level bullet Compiles into: bullet bullet second level bullet second level bullet An enumerated list starts with an arbitrary number: 1. number 1. number 1. second level number 1. second level number Compiles into: number number second level number second level number For more on markdown see https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html. 12.1.3 Rmarkdown Rmarkdown, is an extension of markdown due to RStudio, that allows to incorporate R expressions in the text, that will be evaluated at the time of compilation, and the output automatically inserted in the outputted text. The output can be a .PDF, .DOCX, .HTML or others, thanks to the power of Pandoc. The start of a code chunk is indicated by three backticks and the end of a code chunk is indicated by three backticks. Here is an example. ```{r eval=FALSE} rnorm(10) ``` This chunk will compile to the following output (after setting eval=FALSE to eval=TRUE): rnorm(10) ## [1] -1.4462875 0.3158558 -0.3427475 -1.9313531 0.2428210 -0.3627679 ## [7] 2.4327289 0.5920912 -0.5762008 0.4066282 Things to note: The evaluated expression is added in a chunk of highlighted text, before the R output. The output is prefixed with ##. The eval= argument is not required, since it is set to eval=TRUE by default. It does demonstrate how to set the options of the code chunk. In the same way, we may add a plot: ```{r eval=FALSE} plot(rnorm(10)) ``` which compiles into plot(rnorm(10)) TODO: more code chunk options. You can also call r expressions inline. This is done with a single tick and the r argument. For instance: `r rnorm(1)` is a random Gaussian will output 0.3378953 is a random Gaussian. 12.1.4 BibTex BibTex is both a file format and a compiler. The bibtex compiler links documents to a reference database stored in the .bib file format. Bibtex is typically associated with Tex and LaTex typesetting, but it also operates within the markdown pipeline. Just store your references in a .bib file, add a bibliography: yourFile.bib in the YML preamble of your Rmarkdown file, and call your references from the Rmarkdown text using @referencekey. Rmarkdow will take care of creating the bibliography, and linking to it from the text. 12.1.5 Compiling Once you have your .Rmd file written in RMarkdown, knitr will take care of the compilation for you. You can call the knitr::knitr function directly from some .R file, or more conveniently, use the RStudio (0.96) Knit button above the text editing window. The location of the output file will be presented in the console. 12.2 bookdown As previously stated, bookdown is an extension of knitr intended for documents more complicated than simple reports– such as books. Just like knitr, the writing is done in RMarkdown. Being an extension of knitr, bookdown does allow some markdowns that are not supported by other compilers. In particular, it has a more powerful cross referencing system. 12.3 Shiny Shiny (Chang et al. 2017) is different than the previous systems, because it sets up an interactive web-site, and not a static file. The power of Shiny is that the layout of the web-site, and the settings of the web-server, is made with several simple R commands, with no need for web-programming. Once you have your app up and running, you can setup your own Shiny server on the web, or publish it via Shinyapps.io. The freemium versions of the service can deal with a small amount of traffic. If you expect a lot of traffic, you will probably need the paid versions. 12.3.1 Installation To setup your first Shiny app, you will need the shiny package. You will probably want RStudio, which facilitates the process. install.packages(&#39;shiny&#39;) Once installed, you can run an example app to get the feel of it. library(shiny) runExample(&quot;01_hello&quot;) Remember to press the Stop button in RStudio to stop the web-server, and get back to RStudio. 12.3.2 The Basics of Shiny Every Shiny app has two main building blocks. A user interface, specified via the ui.R file in the app’s directory. A server side, specified via the server.R file, in the app’s directory. You can run the app via the RunApp button in the RStudio interface, of by calling the app’s directory with the shinyApp or runApp functions– the former designed for single-app projects, and the latter, for multiple app projects. shiny::runApp(&quot;my_app&quot;) The site’s layout, is specified via layout functions in the iu.R file. For instance, the function sidebarLayout, as the name suggest, will create a sidebar. More layouts are detailed in the layout guide. The active elements in the UI, that control your report, are known as widgets. Each widget will have a unique inputId so that it’s values can be sent from the UI to the server. More about widgets, in the widget gallery. The inputId on the UI are mapped to input arguments on the server side. The value of the mytext inputId can be queried by the server using input$mytext. These are called reactive values. The way the server “listens” to the UI, is governed by a set of functions that must wrap the input object. These are the observe, reactive, and reactive* class of functions. With observe the server will get triggered when any of the reactive values change. With observeEvent the server will only be triggered by specified reactive values. Using observe is easier, and observeEvent is more prudent programming. A reactive function is a function that gets triggered when a reactive element changes. It is defined on the server side, and reside within an observe function. We now analyze the 1_Hello app using these ideas. Here is the io.R file. library(shiny) shinyUI(fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Hello Shiny!&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( sliderInput(inputId = &quot;bins&quot;, label = &quot;Number of bins:&quot;, min = 1, max = 50, value = 30) ), mainPanel( plotOutput(outputId = &quot;distPlot&quot;) ) ) )) Here is the server.R file: library(shiny) shinyServer(function(input, output) { output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ x &lt;- faithful[, 2] # Old Faithful Geyser data bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1) hist(x, breaks = bins, col = &#39;darkgray&#39;, border = &#39;white&#39;) }) }) Things to note: ShinyUI is a (deprecated) wrapper for the UI. fluidPage ensures that the proportions of the elements adapt to the window side, thus, are fluid. The building blocks of the layout are a title, and the body. The title is governed by titlePanel, and the body is governed by sidebarLayout. The sidebarLayout includes the sidebarPanel to control the sidebar, and the mainPanel for the main panel. sliderInput calls a widget with a slider. Its inputId is bins, which is later used by the server within the renderPlot reactive function. plotOutput specifies that the content of the mainPanel is a plot (textOutput for text). This expectation is satisfied on the server side with the renderPlot function (renderText). shinyServer is a (deprecated) wrapper function for the server. The server runs a function with an input and an output. The elements of input are the inputIds from the UI. The elements of the output will be called by the UI using their outputId. This is the output. knitr::include_url(&#39;http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/example-01-hello.html&#39;) Here is another example, taken from the RStudio Shiny examples. ui.R: library(shiny) fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Tabsets&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel( radioButtons(inputId = &quot;dist&quot;, label = &quot;Distribution type:&quot;, c(&quot;Normal&quot; = &quot;norm&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot; = &quot;unif&quot;, &quot;Log-normal&quot; = &quot;lnorm&quot;, &quot;Exponential&quot; = &quot;exp&quot;)), br(), sliderInput(inputId = &quot;n&quot;, label = &quot;Number of observations:&quot;, value = 500, min = 1, max = 1000) ), mainPanel( tabsetPanel(type = &quot;tabs&quot;, tabPanel(title = &quot;Plot&quot;, plotOutput(outputId = &quot;plot&quot;)), tabPanel(title = &quot;Summary&quot;, verbatimTextOutput(outputId = &quot;summary&quot;)), tabPanel(title = &quot;Table&quot;, tableOutput(outputId = &quot;table&quot;)) ) ) ) ) server.R: library(shiny) # Define server logic for random distribution application function(input, output) { data &lt;- reactive({ dist &lt;- switch(input$dist, norm = rnorm, unif = runif, lnorm = rlnorm, exp = rexp, rnorm) dist(input$n) }) output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({ dist &lt;- input$dist n &lt;- input$n hist(data(), main=paste(&#39;r&#39;, dist, &#39;(&#39;, n, &#39;)&#39;, sep=&#39;&#39;)) }) output$summary &lt;- renderPrint({ summary(data()) }) output$table &lt;- renderTable({ data.frame(x=data()) }) } Things to note: We reused the sidebarLayout. As the name suggests, radioButtons is a widget that produces radio buttons, above the sliderInput widget. Note the different inputIds. Different widgets are separated in sidebarPanel by commas. br() produces extra vertical spacing. tabsetPanel produces tabs in the main output panel. tabPanel governs the content of each panel. Notice the use of various output functions (plotOutput,verbatimTextOutput, tableOutput) with corresponding outputIds. In server.R we see the usual function(input,output). The reactive function tells the server the trigger the function whenever input changes. The output object is constructed outside the reactive function. See how the elements of output correspond to the outputIds in the UI. This is the output: knitr::include_url(&#39;https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/tabsets.html&#39;) 12.3.3 Beyond the Basics Now that we have seen the basics, we may consider extensions to the basic report. 12.3.3.1 Widgets actionButton Action Button. checkboxGroupInput A group of check boxes. checkboxInput A single check box. dateInput A calendar to aid date selection. dateRangeInput A pair of calendars for selecting a date range. fileInput A file upload control wizard. helpText Help text that can be added to an input form. numericInput A field to enter numbers. radioButtons A set of radio buttons. selectInput A box with choices to select from. sliderInput A slider bar. submitButton A submit button. textInput A field to enter text. See examples here. knitr::include_url(&#39;https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html&#39;) 12.3.3.2 Output Elements The ui.R output types. htmlOutput raw HTML. imageOutput image. plotOutput plot. tableOutput table. textOutput text. uiOutput raw HTML. verbatimTextOutput text. The corresponding server.R renderers. renderImage images (saved as a link to a source file) renderPlot plots renderPrint any printed output renderTable data frame, matrix, other table like structures renderText character strings renderUI a Shiny tag object or HTML Your Shiny app can use any R object. The things to remember: The working directory of the app is the location of server.R. The code before shinyServer is run only once. The code inside `shinyServer is run whenever a reactive is triggered, and may thus slow things.

If you are developing packages, you should be careful since using these packages may create many dependencies and compatibility issues. If you are analyzing data, and the portability of your functions to other users, machines, and operating systems is not of a concern, you will LOVE these packages. The term Hadleyverse refers to all of Hadley’s packages, but here, we mention only a useful subset, which can be collectively installed via the tidyverse package: ggplot2 for data visualization. See the Plotting Chapter 11. dplyr for data manipulation. tidyr for data tidying. readr for data import. stringr for character strings. anytime for time data. 13.1 readr The readr package (Wickham, Hester, and Francois 2016) replaces base functions for importing and exporting data such as read.table. It is faster, with a cleaner syntax. We will not go into the details and refer the reader to the official documentation here and the R for data sciecne book. 13.2 dplyr When you think of data frame operations, think dplyr (Wickham and Francois 2016). Notable utilities in the package include: select() Select columns from a data frame. filter() Filter rows according to some condition(s). arrange() Sort / Re-order rows in a data frame. mutate() Create new columns or transform existing ones. group_by() Group a data frame by some factor(s) usually in conjunction to summary. summarize() Summarize some values from the data frame or across groups. inner_join(x,y,by=&quot;col&quot;)return all rows from ‘x’ where there are matching values in ‘x’, and all columns from ‘x’ and ‘y’. If there are multiple matches between ‘x’ and ‘y’, all combination of the matches are returned. left_join(x,y,by=&quot;col&quot;) return all rows from ‘x’, and all columns from ‘x’ and ‘y’. Rows in ‘x’ with no match in ‘y’ will have ‘NA’ values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between ‘x’ and ‘y’, all combinations of the matches are returned. right_join(x,y,by=&quot;col&quot;) return all rows from ‘y’, and all columns from ‘x’ and y. Rows in ‘y’ with no match in ‘x’ will have ‘NA’ values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between ‘x’ and ‘y’, all combinations of the matches are returned. anti_join(x,y,by=&quot;col&quot;) return all rows from ‘x’ where there are not matching values in ‘y’, keeping just columns from ‘x’. The following example involve data.frame objects, but dplyr can handle other classes. In particular data.tables from the data.table package (Dowle and Srinivasan 2017), which is designed for very large data sets. dplyr can work with data stored in a database. In which case, it will convert your command to the appropriate SQL syntax, and issue it to the database. This has the advantage that (a) you do not need to know the specific SQL implementation of your database, and (b), you can enjoy the optimized algorithms provided by the database supplier. For more on this, see the databses vignette. The following examples are taken from Kevin Markham. The nycflights13::flights has delay data for US flights. library(nycflights13) flights ## # A tibble: 336,776 x 19 ## year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2013 1 1 517 515 2 830 ## 2 2013 1 1 533 529 4 850 ## 3 2013 1 1 542 540 2 923 ## 4 2013 1 1 544 545 -1 1004 ## 5 2013 1 1 554 600 -6 812 ## 6 2013 1 1 554 558 -4 740 ## 7 2013 1 1 555 600 -5 913 ## 8 2013 1 1 557 600 -3 709 ## 9 2013 1 1 557 600 -3 838 ## 10 2013 1 1 558 600 -2 753 ## # ... with 336,766 more rows, and 12 more variables: sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt;, ## # arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;, tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, ## # origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;, hour &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dttm&gt; The data is of class tbl_df which is an extension of the data.frame class, designed for large data sets. Notice that the printing of flights is short, even without calling the head function. This is a feature of the tbl_df class ( print(data.frame) would try to load all the data, thus take a long time). class(flights) # a tbl_df is an extension of the data.frame class ## [1] &quot;tbl_df&quot; &quot;tbl&quot; &quot;data.frame&quot; Let’s filter the observations from the first day of the first month. Notice how much better (i.e. readable) is the dplyr syntax, with piping, compared to the basic syntax. flights[flights$month == 1 &amp; flights$day == 1, ] # old style library(dplyr) filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1) #dplyr style flights %&gt;% filter(month == 1, day == 1) # dplyr with piping. More filtering. filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 2) # First OR second month. slice(flights, 1:10) # selects first ten rows. arrange(flights, year, month, day) # sort arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay)) # sort descending select(flights, year, month, day) # select columns year, month, and day select(flights, year:day) # select column range select(flights, -(year:day)) # drop columns rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum) # rename column # add a new computed colume mutate(flights, gain = arr_delay - dep_delay, speed = distance / air_time * 60) # you can refer to columns you just created!

The output of group_by recalls the hierarchy of aggregation, and collapses along this hierarchy. We can use dplyr for two table operations, i.e., joins.

["sparse.html", "Chapter 14 Sparse Representations 14.1 Sparse Matrix Representations 14.2 Sparse Matrices and Sparse Models in R 14.3 Bibliographic Notes 14.4 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 14 Sparse Representations Analyzing “bigdata” in R is a challenge because the workspace is memory resident, i.e., all your objects are stored in RAM. As a rule of thumb, fitting models requires about 5 times the size of the data. This means that if you have 1 GB of data, you might need about 5 GB to fit a linear models. We will discuss how to compute out of RAM in the Memory Efficiency Chapter 15. In this chapter, we discuss efficient representations of your data, so that it takes less memory. The fundamental idea, is that if your data is sparse, i.e., there are many zero entries in your data, then a naive data.frame or matrix will consume memory for all these zeroes. If, however, you have many recurring zeroes, it is more efficient to save only the non-zero entries. When we say data, we actually mean the model.matrix. The model.matrix is a matrix that R grows, converting all your factors to numeric variables that can be computed with. Dummy coding of your factors, for instance, is something that is done in your model.matrix. If you have a factor with many levels, you can imagine that after dummy coding it, many zeroes will be present. The Matrix package replaces the matrix class, with several sparse representations of matrix objects. When using sparse representation, and the Matrix package, you will need an implementation of your favorite model fitting algorithm (e.g. lm) that is adapted to these sparse representations; otherwise, R will cast the sparse matrix into a regular (non-sparse) matrix, and you will have saved nothing in RAM. Remark. If you are familiar with MATLAB you should know that one of the great capabilities of MATLAB, is the excellent treatment of sparse matrices with the sparse function. Before we go into details, here is a simple example. We will create a factor of letters with the letters function. Clearly, this factor can take only \\(26\\) values. This means that \\(25/26\\) of the model.matrix will be zeroes after dummy coding. We will compare the memory footprint of the naive model.matrix with the sparse representation of the same matrix. library(magrittr) reps &lt;- 1e6 # number of samples y&lt;-rnorm(reps) x&lt;- letters %&gt;% sample(reps, replace=TRUE) %&gt;% factor The object x is a factor of letters: head(x) ## [1] n x z f a i ## Levels: a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z We dummy code x with the model.matrix function.

Notice that the matrices have the same dimensions: dim(X.1) ## [1] 1000000 26 dim(X.2) ## [1] 1000000 26 The memory footprint of the matrices, given by the pryr::object_size function, are very very different. pryr::object_size(X.1) ## 264 MB pryr::object_size(X.2) ## 12 MB Things to note: The sparse representation takes a whole lot less memory than the non sparse. The as(,&quot;sparseMatrix&quot;) function grows the dummy variable representation of the factor x. The pryr package provides many facilities for inspecting the memory footprint of your objects and code. With a sparse representation, we not only saved on RAM, but also on the computing time of fitting a model. Here is the timing of a non sparse representation: system.time(lm.1 &lt;- lm(y ~ X.1)) ## user system elapsed ## 3.828 0.120 3.946 Well actually, lm is a wrapper for the lm.fit function. If we override all the overhead of lm, and call lm.fit directly, we gain some time: system.time(lm.1 &lt;- lm.fit(y=y, x=X.1)) ## user system elapsed ## 1.080 0.008 1.088 We now do the same with the sparse representation: system.time(lm.2 &lt;- MatrixModels:::lm.fit.sparse(X.2,y)) ## user system elapsed ## 0.208 0.012 0.224 It is only left to verify that the returned coefficients are the same: all.equal(lm.2, unname(lm.1$coefficients), tolerance = 1e-12) ## [1] TRUE You can also visualize the non zero entries, i.e., the sparsity structure. image(X.2[1:26,1:26]) 14.1 Sparse Matrix Representations We first distinguish between the two main goals of the efficient representation: (i) efficient writing, i.e., modification; (ii) efficient reading, i.e., access. For our purposes, we will typically want efficient reading, since the model.matrix will not change while a model is being fitted. Representations designed for writing include the dictionary of keys, list of lists, and a coordinate list. Representations designed for efficient reading include the compressed sparse row and compressed sparse column. 14.1.1 Coordinate List Representation A coordinate list representation, also known as COO, or triplet represantation is simply a list of the non zero entries. Each element in the list is a triplet of the column, row, and value, of each non-zero entry in the matrix. 14.1.2 Compressed Column Oriented Representation A compressed column oriented representation, also known as compressed sparse column, or CSC, where the column index is similar to COO, but instead of saving the row indexes, we save the locations in the column index vectors where the row index has to increase. The following figure may clarify this simple idea. The CSC data structure. From Shah and Gilbert (2004). Remember that MATLAB is written in C, where the indexing starts at \\(0\\), and not \\(1\\). The nature of statistical applications is such, that CSC representation is typically the most economical, justifying its popularity. 14.1.3 Compressed Row Oriented Representation A compressed row oriented representation, also known as compressed sparse row, or CSR, is very similar to CSC, after switching the role of rows and columns. CSR is much less popular than CSC. 14.1.4 Sparse Algorithms We will go into the details of some algorithms in the Numerical Linear Algebra Chapter 17. For our current purposes two things need to be emphasized: A mathematician may write \\(Ax=b \\Rightarrow x=A^{-1}b\\). A computer, however, would never compute \\(A^{-1}\\) in order to find \\(x\\), but rather use one of many endlessly many numerical algorithms. Working with sparse representations requires using a function that is aware of the representation you are using. 14.2 Sparse Matrices and Sparse Models in R 14.2.1 The Matrix Package The Matrix package provides facilities to deal with real (stored as double precision), logical and so-called “pattern” (binary) dense and sparse matrices. There are provisions to provide integer and complex (stored as double precision complex) matrices. The sparse matrix classes include: TsparseMatrix: a virtual class of the various sparse matrices in triplet representation. CsparseMatrix: a virtual class of the various sparse matrices in CSC representation. RsparseMatrix: a virtual class of the various sparse matrices in CSR representation. For matrices of real numbers, stored in double precision, the Matrix package provides the following (non virtual) classes: dgTMatrix: a general sparse matrix of doubles, in triplet representation. dgCMatrix: a general sparse matrix of doubles, in CSC representation. dsCMatrix: a symmetric sparse matrix of doubles, in CSC representation. dtCMatrix: a triangular sparse matrix of doubles, in CSC representation. Why bother with distinguishing between the different shapes of the matrix? Because the more structure is assumed on a matrix, the more our (statistical) algorithms can be optimized. For our purposes dgCMatrix will be the most useful. 14.2.2 The MatrixModels Package TODO 14.2.3 The glmnet Package As previously stated, an efficient storage of the model.matrix is half of the story. We now need implementations of our favorite statistical algorithms that make use of this representation. At the time of writing, a very useful package that does that is the glmnet package, which allows to fit linear models, generalized linear models, with ridge, lasso, and elastic net regularization. The glmnet package allows all of this, using the sparse matrices of the Matrix package. The following example is taken from John Myles White’s blog, and compares the runtime of fitting an OLS model, using glmnet with both sparse and dense matrix representations. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(&#39;glmnet&#39;)) set.seed(1) performance &lt;- data.frame() for (sim in 1:10){ n &lt;- 10000 p &lt;- 500 nzc &lt;- trunc(p / 10) x &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n * p), n, p) #make a dense matrix iz &lt;- sample(1:(n * p), size = n * p * 0.85, replace = FALSE) x[iz] &lt;- 0 # sparsify by injecting zeroes sx &lt;- Matrix(x, sparse = TRUE) # save as a sparse object beta &lt;- rnorm(nzc) fx &lt;- x[, seq(nzc)] %*% beta eps &lt;- rnorm(n) y &lt;- fx + eps # make data # Now to the actual model fitting: sparse.times &lt;- system.time(fit1 &lt;- glmnet(sx, y)) # sparse glmnet full.times &lt;- system.time(fit2 &lt;- glmnet(x, y)) # dense glmnet sparse.size &lt;- as.numeric(object.size(sx)) full.size &lt;- as.numeric(object.size(x)) performance &lt;- rbind(performance, data.frame(Format = &#39;Sparse&#39;, UserTime = sparse.times[1], SystemTime = sparse.times[2], ElapsedTime = sparse.times[3], Size = sparse.size)) performance &lt;- rbind(performance, data.frame(Format = &#39;Full&#39;, UserTime = full.times[1], SystemTime = full.times[2], ElapsedTime = full.times[3], Size = full.size)) } Things to note: The simulation calls glmnet twice. Once with the non-sparse object x, and once with its sparse version sx. The degree of sparsity of sx is \\(85\\%\\). We know this because we “injected” zeroes in \\(0.85\\) of the locations of x. Because y is continuous glmnet will fit a simple OLS model. We will see later how to use it to fit GLMs and use lasso, ridge, and elastic-net regularization. We now inspect the computing time, and the memory footprint, only to discover that sparse representations make a BIG difference. suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(&#39;ggplot2&#39;)) ggplot(performance, aes(x = Format, y = ElapsedTime, fill = Format)) + stat_summary(fun.data = &#39;mean_cl_boot&#39;, geom = &#39;bar&#39;) + stat_summary(fun.data = &#39;mean_cl_boot&#39;, geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Elapsed Time in Seconds&#39;) ggplot(performance, aes(x = Format, y = Size / 1000000, fill = Format)) + stat_summary(fun.data = &#39;mean_cl_boot&#39;, geom = &#39;bar&#39;) + stat_summary(fun.data = &#39;mean_cl_boot&#39;, geom = &#39;errorbar&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Matrix Size in MB&#39;) How do we perform other types of regression with the glmnet? We just need to use the family and alpha arguments of glmnet::glmnet. The family argument governs the type of GLM to fit: logistic, Poisson, probit, or other types of GLM. The alpha argument controls the type of regularization. Set to alpha=0 for ridge, alpha=1 for lasso, and any value in between for elastic-net regularization. 14.2.4 The SparseM Package 14.3 Bibliographic Notes The best place to start reading on sparse representations and algorithms is the vignettes of the Matrix package. Gilbert, Moler, and Schreiber (1992) is also a great read for some general background. For the theory on solving sparse linear systems see Davis (2006). For general numerical linear algebra see Gentle (2012). 14.4 Practice Yourself References "],

(2013), it was quite puzzling when very few of the competitors, for the Million dollars prize in the Netflix challenge, were statisticians. This is perhaps because the statistical community historically uses SAS, SPSS, and R. The first two tools are very well equipped to deal with big data, but are very unfriendly when trying to implement a new method. R, on the other hand, is very friendly for innovation, but was not equipped to deal with the large data sets of the Netflix challenge. A lot has changed in R since 2006. This is the topic of this chapter. As we have seen in the Sparsity Chapter 14, an efficient representation of your data in RAM will reduce computing time, and will allow you to fit models that would otherwise require tremendous amounts of RAM. Not all problems are sparse however. It is also possible that your data does not fit in RAM, even if sparse. There are several scenarios to consider: Your data fits in RAM, but is too big to compute with. Your data does not fit in RAM, but fits in your local storage (HD, SSD, etc.) Your data does not fit in your local storage. If your data fits in RAM, but is too large to compute with, a solution is to replace the algorithm you are using. Instead of computing with the whole data, your algorithm will compute with parts of the data, also called chunks, or batches. These algorithms are known as external memory algorithms (EMA). If your data does not fit in RAM, but fits in your local storage, you have two options. The first is to save your data in a database management system (DBMS). This will allow you to use the algorithms provided by your DBMS, or let R use an EMA while “chunking” from your DBMS. Alternatively, and preferably, you may avoid using a DBMS, and work with the data directly form your local storage by saving your data in some efficient manner. Finally, if your data does not fit on you local storage, you will need some external storage solution such as a distributed DBMS, or distributed file system. Remark. If you use Linux, you may be better of than Windows users. Linux will allow you to compute with larger datasets using its swap file that extends RAM using your HD or SSD. On the other hand, relying on the swap file is a BAD practice since it is much slower than RAM, and you can typically do much better using the tricks of this chapter. Also, while I LOVE Linux, I would never dare to recommend switching to Linux just to deal with memory contraints. 15.1 Efficient Computing from RAM If our data can fit in RAM, but is still too large to compute with it (recall that fitting a model requires roughly 5-10 times more memory than saving it), there are several facilities to be used. The first, is the sparse representation discussed in Chapter 14, which is relevant when you have factors, which will typically map to sparse model matrices. Another way is to use external memory algorithms (EMA). The biglm::biglm function provides an EMA for linear regression. The following if taken from the function’s example. data(trees) ff&lt;-log(Volume)~log(Girth)+log(Height) chunk1&lt;-trees[1:10,] chunk2&lt;-trees[11:20,] chunk3&lt;-trees[21:31,] library(biglm) a &lt;- biglm(ff,chunk1) a &lt;- update(a,chunk2) a &lt;- update(a,chunk3) coef(a) ## (Intercept) log(Girth) log(Height) ## -6.631617 1.982650 1.117123 Things to note: The data has been chunked along rows. The initial fit is done with the biglm function. The model is updated with further chunks using the update function. We now compare it to the in-memory version of lm to verify the results are the same. b &lt;- lm(ff, data=trees) rbind(coef(a),coef(b)) ## (Intercept) log(Girth) log(Height) ## [1,] -6.631617 1.98265 1.117123 ## [2,] -6.631617 1.98265 1.117123 Other packages that follow these lines, particularly with classification using SVMs, are LiblineaR, and RSofia. 15.1.1 Summary Statistics from RAM If you are not going to do any model fitting, and all you want is efficient filtering, selection and summary statistics, then a lot of my warnings above are irrelevant. For these purposes, the facilities provided by base, stats, and dplyr are probably enough. If the data is large, however, these facilities may be too slow. If your data fits into RAM, but speed bothers you, take a look at the data.table package. The syntax is less friendly than dplyr, but data.table is BLAZING FAST compared to competitors. Here is a little benchmark26. First, we setup the data. library(data.table) n &lt;- 1e6 # number of rows k &lt;- c(200,500) # number of distinct values for each &#39;group_by&#39; variable p &lt;- 3 # number of variables to summarize L1 &lt;- sapply(k, function(x) as.character(sample(1:x, n, replace = TRUE) )) L2 &lt;- sapply(1:p, function(x) rnorm(n) ) tbl &lt;- data.table(L1,L2) %&gt;% setnames(c(paste(&quot;v&quot;,1:length(k),sep=&quot;&quot;), paste(&quot;x&quot;,1:p,sep=&quot;&quot;) )) tbl_dt &lt;- tbl tbl_df &lt;- tbl %&gt;% as.data.frame We compare the aggregation speeds. Here is the timing for dplyr. system.time( tbl_df %&gt;% group_by(v1,v2) %&gt;% summarize( x1 = sum(abs(x1)), x2 = sum(abs(x2)), x3 = sum(abs(x3)) ) ) ## user system elapsed ## 7.360 0.000 7.356 And now the timing for data.table. system.time( tbl_dt[ , .( x1 = sum(abs(x1)), x2 = sum(abs(x2)), x3 = sum(abs(x3)) ), .(v1,v2)] ) ## user system elapsed ## 0.856 0.276 1.131 The winner is obvious. Let’s compare filtering (i.e. row subsets, i.e. SQL’s SELECT). system.time( tbl_df %&gt;% filter(v1 == &quot;1&quot;) ) ## user system elapsed ## 0.560 0.244 0.804 system.time( tbl_dt[v1 == &quot;1&quot;] ) ## user system elapsed ## 0.180 0.204 0.385 15.2 Computing from a Database The early solutions to oversized data relied on storing your data in some DBMS such as MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLite, H2, Oracle, etc. Several R packages provide interfaces to these DBMSs, such as sqldf, RDBI, RSQite. Some will even include the DBMS as part of the package itself. Storing your data in a DBMS has the advantage that you can typically rely on DBMS providers to include very efficient algorithms for the queries they support. On the downside, SQL queries may include a lot of summary statistics, but will rarely include model fitting27. This means that even for simple things like linear models, you will have to revert to R’s facilities– typically some sort of EMA with chunking from the DBMS. For this reason, and others, we prefer to compute from efficient file structures, as described in Section 15.3. If, however, you have a powerful DBMS around, or you only need summary statistics, or you are an SQL master, keep reading. The package RSQLite includes an SQLite server, which we now setup for demonstration. The package dplyr, discussed in the Hadleyverse Chapter 13, will take care of translating the dplyr syntax, to the SQL syntax of the DBMS. The following example is taken from the dplyr Databases vignette. library(RSQLite) library(dplyr) file.remove(&#39;my_db.sqlite3&#39;) ## [1] TRUE my_db &lt;- src_sqlite(path = &quot;my_db.sqlite3&quot;, create = TRUE) library(nycflights13) flights_sqlite &lt;- copy_to( dest= my_db, df= flights, temporary = FALSE, indexes = list(c(&quot;year&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;day&quot;), &quot;carrier&quot;, &quot;tailnum&quot;)) Things to note: src_sqlite to start an empty table, managed by SQLite, at the desired path. copy_to copies data from R to the database. Typically, setting up a DBMS like this makes no sense, since it requires loading the data into RAM, which is precisely what we want to avoid. We can now start querying the DBMS. select(flights_sqlite, year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 5] ## # Database: sqlite 3.19.3 [my_db.sqlite3] ## year month day dep_delay arr_delay ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2013 1 1 2 11 ## 2 2013 1 1 4 20 ## 3 2013 1 1 2 33 ## 4 2013 1 1 -1 -18 ## 5 2013 1 1 -6 -25 ## 6 2013 1 1 -4 12 ## 7 2013 1 1 -5 19 ## 8 2013 1 1 -3 -14 ## 9 2013 1 1 -3 -8 ## 10 2013 1 1 -2 8 ## # ... with more rows filter(flights_sqlite, dep_delay &gt; 240) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 19] ## # Database: sqlite 3.19.3 [my_db.sqlite3] ## year month day dep_time sched_dep_time dep_delay arr_time ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2013 1 1 848 1835 853 1001 ## 2 2013 1 1 1815 1325 290 2120 ## 3 2013 1 1 1842 1422 260 1958 ## 4 2013 1 1 2115 1700 255 2330 ## 5 2013 1 1 2205 1720 285 46 ## 6 2013 1 1 2343 1724 379 314 ## 7 2013 1 2 1332 904 268 1616 ## 8 2013 1 2 1412 838 334 1710 ## 9 2013 1 2 1607 1030 337 2003 ## 10 2013 1 2 2131 1512 379 2340 ## # ... with more rows, and 12 more variables: sched_arr_time &lt;int&gt;, ## # arr_delay &lt;dbl&gt;, carrier &lt;chr&gt;, flight &lt;int&gt;, tailnum &lt;chr&gt;, ## # origin &lt;chr&gt;, dest &lt;chr&gt;, air_time &lt;dbl&gt;, distance &lt;dbl&gt;, hour &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # minute &lt;dbl&gt;, time_hour &lt;dbl&gt; summarise(flights_sqlite, delay = mean(dep_time)) ## # Source: lazy query [?? x 1] ## # Database: sqlite 3.19.3 [my_db.sqlite3] ## delay ## &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1349.11 15.3 Computing From Efficient File Structrures It is possible to save your data on your storage device, without the DBMS layer to manage it. This has several advantages: You don’t need to manage a DBMS. You don’t have the computational overhead of the DBMS. You may optimize the file structure for statistical modelling, and not for join and summary operations, as in relational DBMSs. There are several facilities that allow you to save and compute directly from your storage: Memory Mapping: Where RAM addresses are mapped to a file on your storage. This extends the RAM to the capacity of your storage (HD, SSD,…). Performance slightly deteriorates, but the access is typically very fast. This approach is implemented in the bigmemory package. Efficient Binaries: Where the data is stored as a file on the storage device. The file is binary, with a well designed structure, so that chunking is easy. This approach is implemented in the ff package, and the commercial RevoScaleR package. Your algorithms need to be aware of the facility you are using. For this reason each facility ( bigmemory, ff, RevoScaleR,…) has an eco-system of packages that implement various statistical methods using that facility. As a general rule, you can see which package builds on a package using the Reverse Depends entry in the package description. For the bigmemory package, for instance, we can see that the packages bigalgebra, biganalytics, bigFastlm, biglasso, bigpca, bigtabulate, GHap, and oem, build upon it. We can expect this list to expand. Here is a benchmark result, from Wang et al. (2015). It can be seen that ff and bigmemory have similar performance, while RevoScaleR (RRE in the figure) outperforms them. This has to do both with the efficiency of the binary representation, but also because RevoScaleR is inherently parallel. More on this in the Parallelization Chapter 16. 15.3.1 bigmemory We now demonstrate the workflow of the bigmemory package. We will see that bigmemory, with it’s big.matrix object is a very powerful mechanism. If you deal with big numeric matrices, you will find it very useful. If you deal with big data frames, or any other non-numeric matrix, bigmemory may not be the appropriate tool, and you should try ff, or the commercial RevoScaleR. # download.file(&quot;http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/BSAPUFS/Downloads/2010_Carrier_PUF.zip&quot;, &quot;2010_Carrier_PUF.zip&quot;) # unzip(zipfile=&quot;2010_Carrier_PUF.zip&quot;) library(&quot;bigmemory&quot;) x &lt;- read.big.matrix(&quot;data/2010_BSA_Carrier_PUF.csv&quot;, header = TRUE, backingfile = &quot;airline.bin&quot;, descriptorfile = &quot;airline.desc&quot;, type = &quot;integer&quot;) dim(x) ## [1] 2801660 11 pryr::object_size(x) ## 616 B class(x) ## [1] &quot;big.matrix&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;bigmemory&quot; Things to note: The basic building block of the bigmemory ecosystem, is the big.matrix class, we constructed with read.big.matrix. read.big.matrix handles the import to R, and the saving to a memory mapped file. The implementation is such that at no point does R hold the data in RAM. The memory mapped file will be there after the session is over. It can thus be called by other R sessions using attach.big.matrix(&quot;airline.desc&quot;). This will be useful when parallelizing. pryr::object_size return the size of the object. Since x holds only the memory mappings, it is much smaller than the 100MB of data that it holds. We can now start computing with the data. Many statistical procedures for the big.matrix object are provided by the biganalytics package. In particular, the biglm.big.matrix and bigglm.big.matrix functions, provide an interface from big.matrix objects, to the EMA linear models in biglm::biglm and biglm::bigglm. library(biganalytics) biglm.2 &lt;- bigglm.big.matrix(BENE_SEX_IDENT_CD~CAR_LINE_HCPCS_CD, data=x) coef(biglm.2) ## (Intercept) CAR_LINE_HCPCS_CD ## 1.537848e+00 1.210282e-07 Other notable packages that operate with big.matrix objects include: bigtabulate: Extend the bigmemory package with ‘table’, ‘tapply’, and ‘split’ support for ‘big.matrix’ objects. bigalgebra: For matrix operation. bigpca: principle components analysis (PCA), or singular value decomposition (SVD). bigFastlm: for (fast) linear models. biglasso: extends lasso and elastic nets. GHap: Haplotype calling from phased SNP data. 15.4 ff The ff packages replaces R’s in-RAM storage mechanism with on-disk (efficient) storage. Unlike bigmemory, ff supports all of R vector types such as factors, and not only numeric. Unlike big.matrix, which deals with (numeric) matrices, the ffdf class can deal with data frames. Here is an example. First open a connection to the file, without actually importing it using the LaF::laf_open_csv function. .dat &lt;- LaF::laf_open_csv(filename = &quot;data/2010_BSA_Carrier_PUF.csv&quot;, column_types = c(&quot;integer&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;categorical&quot;, &quot;categorical&quot;, &quot;categorical&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;categorical&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;, &quot;integer&quot;), column_names = c(&quot;sex&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;diagnose&quot;, &quot;healthcare.procedure&quot;, &quot;typeofservice&quot;, &quot;service.count&quot;, &quot;provider.type&quot;, &quot;servicesprocessed&quot;, &quot;place.served&quot;, &quot;payment&quot;, &quot;carrierline.count&quot;), skip = 1) Now write the data to local storage as an ff data frame, using laf_to_ffdf. data.ffdf &lt;- ffbase::laf_to_ffdf(laf = .dat) head(data.ffdf) ## ffdf (all open) dim=c(2801660,6), dimorder=c(1,2) row.names=NULL ## ffdf virtual mapping ## PhysicalName VirtualVmode PhysicalVmode AsIs ## sex sex integer integer FALSE ## age age integer integer FALSE ## diagnose diagnose integer integer FALSE ## healthcare.procedure healthcare.procedure integer integer FALSE ## typeofservice typeofservice integer integer FALSE ## service.count service.count integer integer FALSE ## VirtualIsMatrix PhysicalIsMatrix PhysicalElementNo ## sex FALSE FALSE 1 ## age FALSE FALSE 2 ## diagnose FALSE FALSE 3 ## healthcare.procedure FALSE FALSE 4 ## typeofservice FALSE FALSE 5 ## service.count FALSE FALSE 6 ## PhysicalFirstCol PhysicalLastCol PhysicalIsOpen ## sex 1 1 TRUE ## age 1 1 TRUE ## diagnose 1 1 TRUE ## healthcare.procedure 1 1 TRUE ## typeofservice 1 1 TRUE ## service.count 1 1 TRUE ## ffdf data ## sex age diagnose healthcare.procedure typeofservice ## 1 1 1 NA 99213 M1B ## 2 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 3 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 4 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 5 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 6 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 7 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## 8 1 1 NA A0425 O1A ## : : : : : : ## 2801653 2 6 V82 85025 T1D ## 2801654 2 6 V82 87186 T1H ## 2801655 2 6 V82 99213 M1B ## 2801656 2 6 V82 99213 M1B ## 2801657 2 6 V82 A0429 O1A ## 2801658 2 6 V82 G0328 T1H ## 2801659 2 6 V86 80053 T1B ## 2801660 2 6 V88 76856 I3B ## service.count ## 1 1 ## 2 1 ## 3 1 ## 4 2 ## 5 2 ## 6 3 ## 7 3 ## 8 4 ## : : ## 2801653 1 ## 2801654 1 ## 2801655 1 ## 2801656 1 ## 2801657 1 ## 2801658 1 ## 2801659 1 ## 2801660 1 We can verify that the ffdf data frame has a small RAM footprint. pryr::object_size(data.ffdf) ## 343 kB The ffbase package provides several statistical tools to compute with ff class objects.

The model formula, payment ~ factor(sex) + factor(age) + place.served, includes factors which cause no difficulty. You cannot inspect the factor coding (dummy? effect?) using model.matrix. This is because EMAs never really construct the whole matrix, let alone, save it in memory. 15.5 matter TODO 15.6 iotools TODO 15.7 HDF5 15.8 DelayedArray 15.8.1 DelayedMatrixStats 15.8.2 beachmat 15.8.3 restfulSE 15.9 Computing from a Distributed File System If your data is SOOO big that it cannot fit on your local storage, you will need a distributed file system or DBMS.

["parallel.html", "Chapter 16 Parallel Computing 16.1 Implicit Parallelism 16.2 Explicit Parallelism 16.3 Bibliographic Notes 16.4 Practice Yourself", " Chapter 16 Parallel Computing You would think that because you have an expensive multicore computer your computations will speed up. Well, no. At least not if you don’t make sure they do. By default, no matter how many cores you have, the operating system will allocate each R session to a single core. For starters, we need to distinguish between two types of parallelism: Explicit parallelism: where the user handles the parallelisation. Implicit parallelism: where the parallelisation is abstracted away from the user. Clearly, implicit parallelism is more desirable, but the state of mathematical computing is such that no sufficiently general implicit parallelism framework exists. The R Consortium is currently financing a major project for a A “Unified Framework For Distributed Computing in R” so we can expect things to change soon. In the meanwhile, most of the parallel implementations are explicit. 16.1 Implicit Parallelism We will not elaborate on implicit parallelism except mentioning the following: You can enjoy parallel linear algebra by replacing the linear algebra libraries with BLAS and LAPACK as described here. You should read the “Parallel computing: Implicit parallelism” section in the excellent High Performance Computing task view, for the latest developments in implicit parallelism. 16.2 Explicit Parallelism R provides many frameworks for explicit parallelism. Because the parallelism is initiated by the user, we first need to decide when to parallelize? As a rule of thumb, you want to parallelise when you encounter a CPU bottleneck, and not a memory bottleneck. Memory bottlenecks are released with sparsity (Chapter 14), or efficient memory usage (Chapter 15). Several ways to diagnose your bottleneck include: Keep your Windows Task Manager, or Linux top open, and look for the CPU load, and RAM loads. The computation takes a long time, and when you stop it pressing ESC, R is immediately responsive. If it is not immediately responsive, you have a memory bottleneck. Profile your code. See Hadley’s guide. For reasons detailed in Kane et al. (2013), we will present the foreach parallelisation package (Analytics and Weston 2015). It will allow us to: Decouple between our parallel algorithm and the parallelisation mechanism: we write parallelisable code once, and can then switch the underlying parallelisation mechanism. Combine with the big.matrix object from Chapter 15 for shared memory parallisation: all the machines may see the same data, so that we don’t need to export objects from machine to machine. What do we mean by “switch the underlying parallesation mechanism”? It means there are several packages that will handle communication between machines. Some are very general and will work on any cluster. Some are more specific and will work only on a single multicore machine (not a cluster) with a particular operating system. These mechanisms include multicore, snow, parallel, and Rmpi. The compatibility between these mechanisms and foreach is provided by another set of packages: doMC , doMPI, doRedis, doParallel, and doSNOW. Remark. I personally prefer the multicore mechanism, with the doMC adapter for foreach. I will not use this combo, however, because multicore will not work on Windows machines. I will thus use the more general snow and doParallel combo. If you do happen to run on Linux, or Unix, you will want to replace all doParallel functionality with doMC. Let’s start with a simple example, taken from “Getting Started with doParallel and foreach”. library(doParallel) cl &lt;- makeCluster(2) registerDoParallel(cl) result &lt;- foreach(i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i) class(result) ## [1] &quot;list&quot; result ## [[1]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1.414214 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 1.732051 Things to note: makeCluster creates an object with the information our cluster. On a single machine it is very simple. On a cluster of machines, you will need to specify the i.p. addresses or other identifiers of the machines. registerDoParallel is used to inform the foreach package of the presence of our cluster. The foreach function handles the looping. In particular note the %dopar operator that ensures that looping is in parallel. %dopar% can be replaced by %do% if you want serial looping (like the for loop), for instance, for debugging. The output of the various machines is collected by foreach to a list object. In this simple example, no data is shared between machines so we are not putting the shared memory capabilities to the test. We can check how many workers were involved using the getDoParWorkers() function. We can check the parallelisation mechanism used with the getDoParName() function. Here is a more involved example. We now try to make Bootstrap inference on the coefficients of a logistic regression. Bootstrapping means that in each iteration, we resample the data, and refit the model. x &lt;- iris[which(iris[,5] != &quot;setosa&quot;), c(1,5)] trials &lt;- 1e4 ptime &lt;- system.time({ r &lt;- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=cbind) %dopar% { ind &lt;- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE) result1 &lt;- glm(x[ind,2]~x[ind,1], family=binomial(logit)) coefficients(result1) } })[3] ptime ## elapsed ## 18.863 Things to note: As usual, we use the foreach function with the %dopar% operator to loop in parallel. The icounts function generates a counter. The .combine=cbind argument tells the foreach function how to combine the output of different machines, so that the returned object is not the default list. How long would that have taken in a simple (serial) loop? We only need to replace %dopar% with %do% to test. stime &lt;- system.time({ r &lt;- foreach(icount(trials), .combine=cbind) %do% { ind &lt;- sample(100, 100, replace=TRUE) result1 &lt;- glm(x[ind,2]~x[ind,1], family=binomial(logit)) coefficients(result1) } })[3] stime ## elapsed ## 37.245 Yes. Parallelising is clearly faster. Let’s see how we can combine the power of bigmemory and foreach by creating a file mapped big.matrix object, which is shared by all machines. The following example is taken from Kane et al. (2013), and uses the big.matrix object we created in Chapter 15. library(bigmemory) x &lt;- attach.big.matrix(&quot;airline.desc&quot;) library(foreach) library(doSNOW) cl &lt;- makeSOCKcluster(rep(&quot;localhost&quot;, 4)) # make a cluster of 4 machines registerDoSNOW(cl) # register machines for foreach() Get a “description” of the big.matrix object that will be used to call it from each machine. xdesc &lt;- describe(x) Split the data along values of BENE_AGE_CAT_CD. G &lt;- split(1:nrow(x), x[, &quot;BENE_AGE_CAT_CD&quot;]) Define a function that computes quantiles of CAR_LINE_ICD9_DGNS_CD. GetDepQuantiles &lt;- function(rows, data) { quantile(data[rows, &quot;CAR_LINE_ICD9_DGNS_CD&quot;], probs = c(0.5, 0.9, 0.99), na.rm = TRUE) } We are all set up to loop, in parallel, and compute quantiles of CAR_LINE_ICD9_DGNS_CD for each value of BENE_AGE_CAT_CD. qs &lt;- foreach(g = G, .combine = rbind) %dopar% { require(&quot;bigmemory&quot;) x &lt;- attach.big.matrix(xdesc) GetDepQuantiles(rows = g, data = x) } qs ## 50% 90% 99% ## result.1 558 793 996 ## result.2 518 789 996 ## result.3 514 789 996 ## result.4 511 789 996 ## result.5 511 790 996 ## result.6 518 796 995 16.2.1 Caution: Implicit with Explicit Parallelism TODO 16.3 Bibliographic Notes For a brief and excellent explanation on parallel computing in R see Schmidberger et al.

This is useful to understand the algebraic properties of \\(x\\), but a computer would never recover \\(x\\) that way. Even the computation of the sample variance, \\(S^2(x)=(n-1)^{-1}\\sum (x_i-\\bar x )^2\\) is not solved that way in a computer, because of numerical and speed considerations. In this chapter, we discuss several ways a computer solves systems of linear equations, with their application to statistics, namely, to OLS problems. 17.1 LU Factorization Definition 17.1 (LU Factorization) For some matrix \\(A\\), the LU factorization is defined as \\[\\begin{align} A = L U \\end{align}\\] where \\(L\\) is unit lower triangular and \\(U\\) is upper triangular. The LU factorization is essentially the matrix notation for the Gaussian elimination you did in your introductory algebra courses. For a square \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, the LU factorization requires \\(n^3/3\\) operations, and stores \\(n^2+n\\) elements in memory. 17.2 Cholesky Factorization Definition 17.2 (Non Negative Matrix) A matrix \\(A\\) is said to be non-negative if \\(x&#39;Ax \\geq 0\\) for all \\(x\\). Seeing the matrix \\(A\\) as a function, non-negative matrices can be thought of as functions that generalize the squaring operation. Definition 17.3 (Cholesky Factorization) For some non-negative matrix \\(A\\), the Cholesky factorization is defined as \\[\\begin{align} A = T&#39; T \\end{align}\\] where \\(T\\) is upper triangular with positive diagonal elements. For obvious reasons, the Cholesky factorization is known as the square root of a matrix. Because Cholesky is less general than LU, it is also more efficient. It can be computed in \\(n^3/6\\) operations, and requires storing \\(n(n+1)/2\\) elements. 17.3 QR Factorization Definition 17.4 (QR Factorization) For some matrix \\(A\\), the QR factorization is defined as \\[\\begin{align} A = Q R \\end{align}\\] where \\(Q\\) is orthogonal and \\(R\\) is upper triangular. The QR factorization is very useful to solve the OLS problem as we will see in 17.6. The QR factorization takes \\(2n^3/3\\) operations to compute. Three major methods for computing the QR factorization exist. These rely on Householder transformations, Givens transformations, and a (modified) Gram-Schmidt procedure (Gentle 2012). 17.4 Singular Value Factorization Definition 17.5 (SVD) For an arbitrary \\(n\\times m\\) matrix \\(A\\), the singular valued decomposition (SVD), is defined as \\[\\begin{align} A = U \\Sigma V&#39; \\end{align}\\] where \\(U\\) is an orthonormal \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, \\(V\\) is an \\(m \\times m\\) orthonormal matrix, and \\(\\Sigma\\) is diagonal. The SVD factorization is very useful for algebraic analysis, but less so for computations. This is because it is (typically) solved via the QR factorization. 17.5 Iterative Methods The various matrix factorizations above may be used to solve a system of linear equations, and in particular, the OLS problem. There is, however, a very different approach to solving systems of linear equations. This approach relies on the fact that solutions of linear systems of equations, can be cast as optimization problems: simply find \\(x\\) by minimizing \\(\\Vert Ax-b \\Vert\\). Some methods for solving (convex) optimization problems are reviewed in the Convex Optimization Chapter @(convex). For our purposes we will just mention that historically (this means in the lm function, and in the LAPACK numerical libraries) the factorization approach was preferred, and now optimization approaches are preferred. This is because the optimization approach is more numerically stable, and easier to parallelize. 17.6 Solving the OLS Problem Recalling the OLS problem in Eq.(5.5): we wish to find \\(\\beta\\) such that \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta:= argmin_\\beta \\{ \\Vert y-X\\beta \\Vert^2_2 \\}. \\end{align}\\] The solution, \\(\\hat \\beta\\) that solves this problem has to satisfy \\[\\begin{align} X&#39;X \\beta = X&#39;y. \\tag{17.1} \\end{align}\\] Eq.(17.1) are known as the normal equations. The normal equations are the link between the OLS problem, and the matrix factorization discussed above. Using the QR decomposition in the normal equations we have that \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat \\beta = R_{(1:p,1:p)}^{-1} y, \\end{align*}\\] where \\((R_{n\\times p})=(R_{(1:p,1:p)},0_{(p+1:n,1:p)})\\) is the 17.7 Bibliographic Notes For an excellent introduction to numerical algorithms in statistics, see Weihs, Mersmann, and Ligges (2013).

If used as a data.frame it will look and feel like a data frame. If, however, it is used with it’s unique capabilities, it will prove faster and easier to manipulate.

If you want to apply a function only to a subset of columns, use the .SDcols argument auto[,lapply(.SD, count.uniques), by=vehicleType, .SDcols=price:gearbox] ## vehicleType price abtest vehicleType yearOfRegistration gearbox ## 1: 1378 2 1 101 3 ## 2: coupe 1994 2 1 75 3 ## 3: suv 1667 2 1 73 3 ## 4: kleinwagen 1927 2 1 75 3 ## 5: limousine 2986 2 1 83 3 ## 6: cabrio 2014 2 1 88 3 ## 7: bus 1784 2 1 65 3 ## 8: kombi 2529 2 1 64 3 ## 9: andere 562 2 1 81 3 21.1 Make your own variables It is very easy to compute new variables auto[,log(price/powerPS),] %&gt;% head # This makes no sense ## [1] Inf 4.567632 4.096387 2.995732 3.954583 1.852000 And if you want to store the result in a new variable, use the := operator auto[,newVar:=log(price/powerPS),] Or create multiple variables at once. The syntax c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;):=.(expression1,expression2)is read “save the list of results from expression1 and expression2 using the vector of names A, and B”. auto[,c(&#39;newVar&#39;,&#39;newVar2&#39;):=.(log(price/powerPS),price^2/powerPS),] 21.2 Join data.table can be used for joining. A join is the operation of aligning two (or more) data frames/tables along some index. The index can be a single variable, or a combination thereof. Here is a simple example of aligning age and gender from two different data tables: DT1 &lt;- data.table(Names=c(&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;), Age=c(29,31)) DT2 &lt;- data.table(Names=c(&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;Carl&quot;), Gender=c(&quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;,&quot;M&quot;)) setkey(DT1, Names) setkey(DT2, Names) DT1[DT2,,] ## Names Age Gender ## 1: Alice 29 F ## 2: Bob 31 M ## 3: Carl NA M DT2[DT1,,] ## Names Gender Age ## 1: Alice F 29 ## 2: Bob M 31 Things to note: A join with data.tables is performed by indexing one data.table with another. Which is the outer and which is the inner will affect the result. The indexing variable needs to be set using the setkey function. There are several types of joins: Inner join: Returns the rows along the intersection of keys, i.e., rows that appear in all data sets. Outer join: Returns the rows along the union of keys, i.e., rows that appear in any of the data sets. Left join: Returns the rows along the index of the “left” data set. Right join: Returns the rows along the index of the “right” data set. Assuming DT1 is the “left” data set, we see that DT1[DT2,,] is a right join, and DT2[DT1,,] is a left join. For an inner join use the nomath=0 argument: DT1[DT2,,,nomatch=0] ## Names Age Gender ## 1: Alice 29 F ## 2: Bob 31 M DT2[DT1,,,nomatch=0] ## Names Gender Age ## 1: Alice F 29 ## 2: Bob M 31 21.3 Reshaping data Data sets (i.e. frames or tables) may arrive in a “wide” form or a “long” form. The difference is best illustrated with an example. The ChickWeight data encodes the weight of various chicks. It is “long” in that a variable encodes the time of measurement, making the data, well, simply long: ChickWeight %&gt;% head ## Grouped Data: weight ~ Time | Chick ## weight Time Chick Diet ## 1 42 0 1 1 ## 2 51 2 1 1 ## 3 59 4 1 1 ## 4 64 6 1 1 ## 5 76 8 1 1 ## 6 93 10 1 1 The mtcars data encodes 10 characteristics of 32 types of automobiles. It is “wide” since the various characteristics are encoded in different variables, making the data, well, simply wide. mtcars %&gt;% head ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Most of R’s functions, with exceptions, will prefer data in the long format. There are thus various facilities to convert from one format to another. We will focus on the melt and dcast functions to convert from one format to another. 21.3.1 Wide to long melt will convert from wide to long. dimnames(mtcars) ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;Mazda RX4&quot; &quot;Mazda RX4 Wag&quot; &quot;Datsun 710&quot; ## [4] &quot;Hornet 4 Drive&quot; &quot;Hornet Sportabout&quot; &quot;Valiant&quot; ## [7] &quot;Duster 360&quot; &quot;Merc 240D&quot; &quot;Merc 230&quot; ## [10] &quot;Merc 280&quot; &quot;Merc 280C&quot; &quot;Merc 450SE&quot; ## [13] &quot;Merc 450SL&quot; &quot;Merc 450SLC&quot; &quot;Cadillac Fleetwood&quot; ## [16] &quot;Lincoln Continental&quot; &quot;Chrysler Imperial&quot; &quot;Fiat 128&quot; ## [19] &quot;Honda Civic&quot; &quot;Toyota Corolla&quot; &quot;Toyota Corona&quot; ## [22] &quot;Dodge Challenger&quot; &quot;AMC Javelin&quot; &quot;Camaro Z28&quot; ## [25] &quot;Pontiac Firebird&quot; &quot;Fiat X1-9&quot; &quot;Porsche 914-2&quot; ## [28] &quot;Lotus Europa&quot; &quot;Ford Pantera L&quot; &quot;Ferrari Dino&quot; ## [31] &quot;Maserati Bora&quot; &quot;Volvo 142E&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] &quot;mpg&quot; &quot;cyl&quot; &quot;disp&quot; &quot;hp&quot; &quot;drat&quot; &quot;wt&quot; &quot;qsec&quot; &quot;vs&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;gear&quot; ## [11] &quot;carb&quot; mtcars$type &lt;- rownames(mtcars) melt(mtcars, id.vars=c(&quot;type&quot;)) %&gt;% head ## type variable value ## 1 Mazda RX4 mpg 21.0 ## 2 Mazda RX4 Wag mpg 21.0 ## 3 Datsun 710 mpg 22.8 ## 4 Hornet 4 Drive mpg 21.4 ## 5 Hornet Sportabout mpg 18.7 ## 6 Valiant mpg 18.1 Things to note: The car type was originally encoded in the rows’ names, and not as a variable. We thus created an explicit variable with the cars’ type using the rownames function. The id.vars of the melt function names the variables that will be used as identifiers. All other variables are assumed to be measurements. These can have been specified using their index instead of their name. If not all variables are measurements, we could have names measurement variables explicitly using the measure.vars argument of the melt function. These can have been specified using their index instead of their name. By default, the molten columns are automatically named variable and value. We can replace the automatic namings using variable.name and value.name: melt(mtcars, id.vars=c(&quot;type&quot;), variable.name=&quot;Charachteristic&quot;, value.name=&quot;Measurement&quot;) %&gt;% head ## type Charachteristic Measurement ## 1 Mazda RX4 mpg 21.0 ## 2 Mazda RX4 Wag mpg 21.0 ## 3 Datsun 710 mpg 22.8 ## 4 Hornet 4 Drive mpg 21.4 ## 5 Hornet Sportabout mpg 18.7 ## 6 Valiant mpg 18.1 21.3.2 Long to wide dcast will conver from long to wide: dcast(ChickWeight, Chick~Time, value.var=&quot;weight&quot;) ## Chick 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 21 ## 1 18 39 35 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 16 41 45 49 51 57 51 54 NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 15 41 49 56 64 68 68 67 68 NA NA NA NA ## 4 13 41 48 53 60 65 67 71 70 71 81 91 96 ## 5 9 42 51 59 68 85 96 90 92 93 100 100 98 ## 6 20 41 47 54 58 65 73 77 89 98 107 115 117 ## 7 10 41 44 52 63 74 81 89 96 101 112 120 124 ## 8 8 42 50 61 71 84 93 110 116 126 134 125 NA ## 9 17 42 51 61 72 83 89 98 103 113 123 133 142 ## 10 19 43 48 55 62 65 71 82 88 106 120 144 157 ## 11 4 42 49 56 67 74 87 102 108 136 154 160 157 ## 12 6 41 49 59 74 97 124 141 148 155 160 160 157 ## 13 11 43 51 63 84 112 139 168 177 182 184 181 175 ## 14 3 43 39 55 67 84 99 115 138 163 187 198 202 ## 15 1 42 51 59 64 76 93 106 125 149 171 199 205 ## 16 12 41 49 56 62 72 88 119 135 162 185 195 205 ## 17 2 40 49 58 72 84 103 122 138 162 187 209 215 ## 18 5 41 42 48 60 79 106 141 164 197 199 220 223 ## 19 14 41 49 62 79 101 128 164 192 227 248 259 266 ## 20 7 41 49 57 71 89 112 146 174 218 250 288 305 ## 21 24 42 52 58 74 66 68 70 71 72 72 76 74 ## 22 30 42 48 59 72 85 98 115 122 143 151 157 150 ## 23 22 41 55 64 77 90 95 108 111 131 148 164 167 ## 24 23 43 52 61 73 90 103 127 135 145 163 170 175 ## 25 27 39 46 58 73 87 100 115 123 144 163 185 192 ## 26 28 39 46 58 73 92 114 145 156 184 207 212 233 ## 27 26 42 48 57 74 93 114 136 147 169 205 236 251 ## 28 25 40 49 62 78 102 124 146 164 197 231 259 265 ## 29 29 39 48 59 74 87 106 134 150 187 230 279 309 ## 30 21 40 50 62 86 125 163 217 240 275 307 318 331 ## 31 33 39 50 63 77 96 111 137 144 151 146 156 147 ## 32 37 41 48 56 68 80 83 103 112 135 157 169 178 ## 33 36 39 48 61 76 98 116 145 166 198 227 225 220 ## 34 31 42 53 62 73 85 102 123 138 170 204 235 256 ## 35 39 42 50 61 78 89 109 130 146 170 214 250 272 ## 36 38 41 49 61 74 98 109 128 154 192 232 280 290 ## 37 32 41 49 65 82 107 129 159 179 221 263 291 305 ## 38 40 41 55 66 79 101 120 154 182 215 262 295 321 ## 39 34 41 49 63 85 107 134 164 186 235 294 327 341 ## 40 35 41 53 64 87 123 158 201 238 287 332 361 373 ## 41 44 42 51 65 86 103 118 127 138 145 146 NA NA ## 42 45 41 50 61 78 98 117 135 141 147 174 197 196 ## 43 43 42 55 69 96 131 157 184 188 197 198 199 200 ## 44 41 42 51 66 85 103 124 155 153 175 184 199 204 ## 45 47 41 53 66 79 100 123 148 157 168 185 210 205 ## 46 49 40 53 64 85 108 128 152 166 184 203 233 237 ## 47 46 40 52 62 82 101 120 144 156 173 210 231 238 ## 48 50 41 54 67 84 105 122 155 175 205 234 264 264 ## 49 42 42 49 63 84 103 126 160 174 204 234 269 281 ## 50 48 39 50 62 80 104 125 154 170 222 261 303 322 Things to note: dcast uses a formula interface (~) to specify the row identifier and the variables. The LHS is the row identifier, and the RHS for the variables to be created. The measurement of each LHS at each RHS, is specified using the value.var argument. 21.4 Bibliographic Notes data.table has excellent online documentation. See here. See here for joining data.tables.
